It's not used right and it should be used only to force the right call, not the give a hint to the referee that he should think about changing his mind.

There's no point for ref to even watch the footage, VAR should just overrule his decision. As viewers on TV we can see it, they can show it on stadium screens as well but there's no point waiting for refs to watch it because I can't remember the last time I saw a VAR footage review that resulted in ref sticking to his original call.

Also I think there should be some kind of a time limit. If they need 3 minutes to make a decision maybe that foul wasn't that obvious and in that case I think VAR should not count. When they take to long to make a call they are changing the dynamic of the match. Sometimes it's irrelevant but sometimes one team can gain advantage because of it - per example defending team on their last legs have a 3-4min break while they are checking. Of course they do check only major calls that are going to change the game either way but still...

So i think VAR refs should be on alert the whole time and should react ASAP and VAR refs should make the final decision. If VAR refs are not sure, original call should stand.

Work out a system where referees from the EPL can monitor Ligue 1 games, ligue 1 monitors série A, série A monitors la liga and so on, with league rotations happening every week.

Also, have people controlling the VAR provide a summary and reasonable explanation as to why a decision was taken either for or against a revised play.

And most importantly, have an established set of criteria to confirm or deny a ruling.

The same handball can be a penalty in one game and ""play-on"" in another. The same tackle can be a direct red card in one game and only a yellow in another.

Offsides are another issue. Semi-automatic offsides have made mistakes this year, additionally - VAR referees are inconsistent when to pause - is it the pass action or the ball actually already on the way to the recipient (in very close situations, this can be the difference between offside and legal play).

The Mbappe offside in the game between Las Palmas and Real just yesterday, was another failure of VAR. It went completely against VAR protocol, because VAR checked the offside in a previous play. When Las Palmas player cleared the ball, it was the end of the play - you either raise the flag there or not, then another Las Palmas player had possession of the ball which he lost and from this stolen ball, Real Madrid scored.

Roma-Monza, step on foot on Baldanzi, probably one of the most clear fouls I've seen this year - not called but surely reviewed.


The fact that it wasn't awarded has to go in the ""call against the club"" even it was a mistake.

Even the Thuram Pavlovic contact from the derby must be considered as a decision in favor of Milan.


If this only takes into account when a VAR check is ""officially called"" and the referee has to go and watch the action back, I can't help but to feel like this list is absolutely useless.

The referees this year have been absolutely devastating (I could mention other offenses for Napoli, Juve, Milan, Atalanta, Torino, Fiorentina, ecc.... but that's not the point) and VAR surely has a blind eye that often doesn't correct the obvious mistake.",Kapt0,15.0,2025-02-19 11:49:16

I think that that, along with altering the method from asking the ref over to a monitor to instead adopting the rugby style of VAR only gets used when the referee asks for assistance, and even then, the final say on the decision belongs to the on field referee would improve it drastically.

Actual VAR, used how it should be, would only elevate the sport. It's one of those things that should be there for blatant handballs but instead is used for mm offside calls.  

The time it takes is awful and the stuff it's limited to changing is wank. It's not hard for someone to watch replays real time and say ""Oi that wasn't a corner, it richoceted back off the attacker, give a goal kick"" and the ref changes it to a goal kick.

But if course we have to protect on field refs egos; they aren't allowed to be wrong. So VAR just stays quiet so the ref can double down.

I also get that VAR has spoiled the match day experience to a degree, but like, if you celebrate a goal and it gets cancelled by VAR, it's a goal that didn't deserve to stand and should be chalked off. If a goal goes in celebrate until you are told otherwise, that's what I do. Seems silly to sit on your hands because you don't know if it's counted or not. If the Var check passes, then you can celebrate a second time. How many goals go in that stand, compared to those that get pulled back by VAR? Barely any are actually denied by VAR in comparison.

Just look at how much time they spend moaning about it in the Prem. Not being used when it perhaps should have been, being used when there was no need for it, goals disallowed because a player’s stud was offside… and at the expense of a game being slowed down for a few minutes while no-one in the stadium has any idea what’s going on. It ruins celebrating goals as well, which is literally the best part of football. 

My only personal experience of it with a team I follow is with England, and it really mutes the goal celebration because you know some bellend is off in a windowless room working out if one pixel of Raheem Sterling’s nipple was offside.

##La Direction technique de l'arbitrage a dévoilé ce mardi les instructifs échanges entre les arbitres et leurs assistants-vidéo lors de PSG-Angers (2-1), avec une énorme erreur, reconnue, puis pendant OM-PSG (0-0), où cela a été bien géré.

Dans une salle de conférence de la Fédération, ce mardi, l'attention des seize journalistes présents, conviés par la DTA (Direction technique de l'arbitrage, au grand complet) était à son comble. Car elle a dévoilé, images en mosaïque à l'appui, les très instructifs échanges sonores lors de quatre décisions arbitrales récemment inversées par le VAR (assistance vidéo à l'arbitrage), une à tort lors de [PSG - Angers (2-1, le 15 octobre)](https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Le-psg-vient-difficilement-a-bout-d-angers-en-ligue-1/1292353), et trois autres à juste titre lors de [Marseille - PSG (0-0, dimanche).](https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/L-om-et-un-psg-reduit-a-dix-se-neutralisent-en-ligue-1/1294517)

Lors du premier, on découvre comment l'examen de la faute évidente et impactante de Mauro Icardi sur Romain Thomas a été complètement zappé, ce qui a conduit à tort l'arbitre, Bastien Dechepy, à accorder un penalty au PSG, [transformé par Mbappé (87e),](https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/match-direct/ligue-1/2021-2022/psg-angers-live/515576) pour une main de Pierrick Capelle suite à une tête d'Icardi.

Alors que le jeu est arrêté, le VAR (l'assistant vidéo), Jérémie Pignard, lance à son opérateur Hawk-Eye (chargé de l'aspect technique) : « *Il y a un hors-jeu à vérifier de Mbappé au départ de l'action. Le 24* (Romain Thomas) *couvre laisse tomber,* *remets-moi sur le penalty. »* Puis il s'adresse à l'arbitre central : *« Bastien, je te recommande de venir voir les images pour la potentielle main* (de Capelle, donc). *On a vérifié l'APP* (phase d'attaque pour s'assurer qu'il n'y a rien en amont).  »

Devant l'écran de contrôle, M. Dechepy s'exprime : *« Je vois un point de contact. OK. Pas de hors-jeu. Tu as vérifié l'APP**. *Donc penalty et avertissement au 15 Blan*c (Capelle)* *».* À ce moment-là, Stéphane Lannoy, DTA adjoint en charge de la vidéo interrompt la séquence pour expliquer : « Il (Pignard, le VAR) *lui dit oui j'ai vérifié le hors-jeu. Mais la faute, le tirage d'Icardi sur Thomas n'a pas été travaillé. C'est vrai, ils se sont plantés réellement, car la décision attendue était de revenir sur cette faute et de ne surtout pas siffler le penalty. Mais quand on est VAR, on est tellement focus sur les vérifications à faire, qu'on peut en oublier une en amont. L'AVAR (l'assistant de l'arbitre vidéo, en l'occurrence ici* Aurélien Berthomieu), *lui dit potentiel hors-jeu, mais ne l'a pas alerté sur la troisième chose... »*

Nous faisons alors remarquer à Stéphane Lannoy : « *Sauf que Romain Thomas le dit à M. Dechepy plusieurs fois pendant le processus. »* Puis nous demandons : *« Pourquoi, du coup, il ne le dit pas à son VAR, attention, Thomas me signale ça, on devrait vérifier, surtout que Thomas insiste ? »*

Lannoy répond : *« Votre remarque est pertinente. Concrètement, ça nous amène à travailler sur ce genre de situations. On est sur de la formation permanente. »* Puis Garibian reprend et reconnaît : *« Oui, il faut être capable de capter les clignotants du terrain. Mais vous croyez que c'est facile quand on est entourés pas cinq six joueurs ? Plus il y a de sérénité, plus les arbitres peuvent capter. Ils ont besoin de la confiance des joueurs. La frustration (du défenseur du SCO) on la comprend et on s'explique après. Le manque de respect, non ! »*

Quant au premier but parisien, marqué par Danilo Pereira (69e), que Gérald Baticle, l'entraîneur angevin, avait aussi contesté pour un hors-jeu du centreur, Kylian Mbappé, on constate dans les échanges qu'il manque un plan probant pour en juger. *« On ne voit pas à droite, on ne voit pas à gauche on ne voit pas dans l'axe, je ne l'ai sur aucune caméra »*, résume le VAR. Il y a donc aussi parfois des angles morts, la technologie ne couvre pas tout, même si *« c'est assez rare »,* comme le souligne Garibian.

Avant son [mea culpa renouvelé](https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Pascal-garibian-reconnait-une-erreur-d-arbitrage-lors-de-psg-angers/1293468) sur la gestion du penalty fatal aux Angevins, la DTA s'était félicitée à juste titre de la bonne gestion des trois inversions effectuées grâce au VAR lors d'OM - PSG (0-0), dimanche. Sur le c.s.c. de Luan Peres pour le PSG (14e), le VAR, Willy Delajod lance en pleine action : « *Check hors-jeu de Neymar si but... et but ! »* L'arbitre, Benoît Bastien, dit : *« C'est vraiment serré au départ. »* L'assistant VAR : *« Définition du point de contact. On zoome, on zoome. On pose le point sur le pied du joueur. Épaule. Donc il est hors-jeu. C'est clair. »* Benoît Bastien s'adresse alors aux joueurs, en attente : *« Si ça prend du temps, c'est qu'il y a peut-être hors-jeu. »* Avant la conclusion logique et pertinente du VAR : « *Neymar est en position de hors-jeu, le but est refusé ! »* Bastien acquiesce.

Quelques minutes plus tard, il y a eu des échanges similaires sur le but annulé, là encore à juste titre, de Milik (21e), donc pour l'OM cette fois. Le VAR, Willy Delajod, lance : *« Potentiel ballon sorti, potentiel hors-jeu. Ça fait but ! »* M. Bastien : *« C'est limite, limite. »* Le VAR : *« On checke tout. Zoome, dézoome. Épaule. Il est hors-jeu. »* M. Bastien : « *Il y a un fumigène sur le terrain. »* Delajod : *« Il y a hors-jeu au départ de l'action. Lirola est hors-jeu, donc le but est refusé. »* Et cette fois, l'APP (le ballon n'était pas sorti en touche) a bien été pleinement vérifié, comme l'a souligné Stéphane Lannoy.

Enfin, il y a eu l'exclusion justifiée d'Achraf Hakimi (57e), alors que dans un premier temps, Benoît Bastien, avait adressé un carton jaune à... Ünder, victime de la faute et qui s'est saisi du ballon de la main en chutant. Le VAR, M. Delajod, lance : *« Contrôle en cours. »* L'arbitre dit : *« Pour moi, il s'écroule au contact. Il tombe et il ramasse le ballon. »* Le VAR : « *Il y a clairement faute. Pour moi, il y a faute. C'est clair, il faut s'assurer s'il y a annihilation d'une occasion nette de but »* L'arbitre s'adresse encore aux joueurs : « *C'est dur, mais on va y arriver. Dans les attitudes, pour l'instant, c'est parfait messieurs. »* Delajod : *« Il y a un clair contact au niveau de la jambe. Viens voir. Je te montre et tu vois. »* L'arbitre face à l'écran de contrôle : « *Vas-y. Mets-moi le plan large. Vitesse réelle. »* Le VAR : *« Le contact est clairement à l'extérieur. »* L'arbitre se dirige vers Hakimi et lui explique pourquoi il sort le rouge, sans siffler penalty : « *Vous êtes le dernier, vous êtes à l'extérieur ».*

Lannoy détaille après-coup : « *C'est la pertinence des images les plus probantes, le choix des angles de caméras, qui permettent ici de montrer à l'arbitre que la décision attendue, c'est carton rouge. Finalement, il se déplace et il est convaincu que c'est la bonne décision »* Pascal Garibian précise de son côté : « *Le timing est important, c'est somme toute assez rapide ! »*",rligue1,1.0,2021-10-26 20:15:43

Dans les défauts actuels de la VAR, il y a je pense l'aspect très restreint de son utilisation. Je serai plutôt pour un système ou le quatrième arbitre en régie est un vrai arbitre indépendant de l'arbitre central qui puisse distribuer des cartons jaunes et rouges sans avoir a être controlé par l'arbitre central.

Quand un arbitre de touche signale un hors-jeu, l'arbitre central lui fait confiance et ne demande pas à chaque fois à regarder la vidéo. Il n'y a que si un but est marqué que la vidéo entre alors en jeu. Alors que parfois le hors-jeu est imaginaire et l'equipe qui attaque aurait dû avoir un corner suite à l'action. Pourquoi faire confiance à l'arbitre de touche et pas à celui du camion régie ? Pareil quand l'arbitre de touche signale une faute méritant carton jaune.

Pour essayer de tuer la VAR dès sa mise en place, on l'a confiné dans un rôle frustrant de sous-fifre avec des règles strictes pour laisser certaines injustices (comme les simulations hors de la surface).
