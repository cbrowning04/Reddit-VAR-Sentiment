Regardless of what happens, the match officials consult and the final decision is made by the ref. This is all audible to the TV audience and they’re making it audible at the stadiums as well.

Now there are specific ways the refs ask questions to communicate and in some ways refs can also get handcuffed by a TMO or vice versa, but the procedure is at least transparent and the reasoning explained there and then.

This video does nothing but make VAR look bad. I’m a lawyer and so all this standard of review stuff is familiar. VAR has a stated standard of review of “clear and obvious error.”  That means that VAR can only intervene if the onfield ref made a clear and obvious error. 

The penalty decision here did not rise to that level. It could have gone either way. Hence, not a clear and obvious error. 

This video and the conversation is centered on basically analyzing “what a penalty is.”  That’s not the controversy here. The controversy is why VAR intervened at all; it all seems arbitrary. Why does Anthony keep asking whether there was contact? Because *if there weren’t*, then Havertz dived and *that* would be a clear and obvious error. But there was contact so VAR is asking refs to review grey areas? That’s not clear and obvious. 

Either lower the standard or stick with them.

Having seen the replay I immediately thought it'd be overturned and would be absolutely furious if it was given against us.

Second penalty imo is a penalty.  The Wolves player gets none of the ball and his knee clips Wilson's knee.  It's a foul, I can see why the ref didn't give it as the angle he had doesn't show the contact however Wilson gets ahead of the Wolves player and gets caught.

However, fouls like that resulting in penalties feels so ridiculously harsh.  There was no danger and he was going away from goal.  Giving the attacking side a goal scoring opportunity for free is way too big a ""reward"" for things like that.  I wouldn't be against a change in the rules where penalties are only given if a goalscoring opportunity is denied, otherwise it's an indirect free kick.  Yes it would add a bit more subjectivity into it but it would also stop attacking players going for balls like this (and also the Cairney one) when they know that if they get a touch on the ball and get slightly clipped then odds are it's a goal.  Tiny inconsequential fouls in the penalty area just shouldn't be a 75/80% chance at a goal.

Vinicius should have been sent off, for the third time this season, for violent conduct.  If he never plays for us again it'd be a day too soon.

There was no chance of him being offside as the ball swung into Stones because you can't be offside from a corner kick. 

What was the position and his actions at and after the header? That is the only point at which he can possibly commit an offside offence. By then he had separated from Sa and wasn't obstructing his view, and the rules are very clear that simply being in an offside position alone without interfering is not an offence. 

I genuinely think this is a fantastic decision from the referee, especially as they know the expectation is that most decisions are overturned when they check the monitor (rightly or wrongly). We give them stick when they fuck up and he deserves credit here.

And lets clarify that Silva standing his ground, or 'backing into' Sa isn't a foul before some people argue that line. You can only be penalised for obstruction if you move into the way of a player as they would try to play the ball, but Silva had already picked up that position before corner.

 Some refs are just crap, but thats everywhere. In these international competitions they pick who they consider are the best ref's, so you would expect less mistakes and better officiating. But the smoothness of this Euros is simply down to the ref's being told to let some hard tackles go and their implementation of VAR seems superb.

Peter Walton and other high profile ex-refs back them up more often than not, and when they disagree they try to make us understand the referee's position. Yes, being a ref is hard. No, that does not mean we have to tolerate moronic logic and decisions.  


Half the shit refs have to put up with from players could be sorted if they were simply mic'ed up - but they won't do that because:  
1 They enjoy the sycophantic nature of thinking their friends with players like Harry Kane because they can call him ""Harry"".  
2 That would help keep them accountable, and increase the level of professionalism expected of them.  


These two things would ruin two of the main reasons these people are where they are - these are the things that motivate them.  


I've been saying it all season, and I've only heard Graeme Souness (ugh) suggest anything similar: Sack them all. Literally all premier league referees. They will be \*fine\*. Move everyone up, promote from below and create a new set of motivating factors. And mic referees the f up. Aim for the level of professionalism expected of rugby refs and players.  


It will be a difficult transition for the divas in the premier league, but it wont take many high profile bans of players swearing at refs and therefore live on television before they change their behaviour. Surrounding the referee ends immediately. Openly lying to the referee about what happens means you get exposed as a cheat because people can actually hear a diver say ""He cleaned me out!"" when nobody touched them, or hear a player say ""I got the ball!"" when they definitely didn't.

MILLIMETRES!,controversial moment VAR Simon Hooper disallows Wolves equaliser offside MILLIMETRES!,"Regardless of the distance being small, it is there, so in this particular frame, the player is offside. However, the problem is how the frame was actually selected. Was it actually selected at the right moment when the player who does the pass makes contact with the ball, or was the timing just off? They didn't show the selection process on TV so there is no way of us actually knowing if it was done correctly. Also, since the selection of the frame is done by humans, what is the margin for error in these situations (this certainly seems like it could lie within it)?

Why doesn't the referee go check the on field monitor like in every other league?",Regardless distance small particular frame player offside problem frame actually selected actually selected right moment player pass makes contact ball timing ? nt selection process TV way actually knowing correctly selection frame humans margin error situations certainly like lie ? nt referee check field monitor like league?,en,en,2019,PremierLeague

 who played the pass to Saka, and then looked to use one of the other   
cameras, which are all time-synced, to apply the offside lines.

I think the reason this system works well is because it's the on-field officials that are making the call and they go to video replay right away. They also then come into the center of the field and announce to the stadium and broadcast what the correct call is and why they are sticking with it or overturning it.

Are they right 100% of the time? No and they never will be, we will always have some sort of human error and that's OK.

1112,173z4wl,k45yj0u,Var narrowly escaped second major blunder in seven days over Raheem Sterling goal,Var narrowly escaped second major blunder seven days Raheem Sterling goal,"***Full story:***

There was another video assistant referee offside-check fiasco in the Premier League during Chelsea’s win at Burnley, it has emerged.  
Less than a week after the Liverpool offside-goal debacle sparked English football’s worst Var crisis – and the immediate adoption of new protocols to avoid a repeat – Saturday’s game at Turf Moor witnessed a similar episode.  
Referee Stuart Attwell was told to stop the match after allowing it to restart before a Var review check of Raheem Sterling’s goal, which made it 3-1, had been completed.  
Unlike the Liverpool debacle, which saw Luis Diaz’s strike wrongly ruled out at Tottenham Hotspur the previous weekend, the check by Darren Bond correctly confirmed the on-field decision, averting an even bigger calamity.

Telegraph Sport has been told Attwell allowed Burnley to kick off after Sterling’s goal because he thought he had heard Bond tell him “check complete”, which would raise major questions about the effectiveness of new protocols announced on Tuesday to prevent such miscommunication.  
The stopping of the game after it had restarted raised further questions about what the officials would have done had the check found Sterling to have been offside.  
The laws of the game prevent goals being chalked off or awarded once play resumes, the particular rule for which was rigorously adhered to during the Spurs-Liverpool match.  
A recording of the Diaz incident disclosed last week how Var Darren England repeatedly insisted “can’t do anything” after the game had restarted following his own gaffe.  
England and assistant Var Dan Cook have played no part in Premier League matches since the debacle but Telegraph Sport has been told Professional Game Match Officials Limited does not view the Burnley-Chelsea incident as warranting similar action against Attwell or Bond.  
It is now the international break and there are no Premier League fixtures for almost a fortnight.

The camera is 60fps. So at the strict minimum you have an uncertainty of measurement of :
1/2 * 1/60 * 30/3.6 = 0.069m = 7cm

that’s assuming we can determine the precise frame closest to the shot, measure the lines exactly and consistently. This also consider the defenders is still. If the defenders move with the attackers the speed differential would decrease.

I got curious so I looked and Broadcast cameras are 50fps (https://www.premierleague.com/news/1488423). They mention they use the broadcast cameras to find out the moment the pass is made, and to synchronize the cameras. Assuming all cameras have exactly they same shutter speed (so once they are synchronized the dont phase out of sync) we got the uncertainty :
U = Usync + Upass 
= 2* Uone_frame
= 1/50 * 30/3.6
= 0.166 = 17cm

And that’s being very generous and looking at only the shot position. Btw looking at pictures the line width seems to be around 5cm so the uncertainty on shot positioning is greater than three line widths.

Line position uncertainty is half the line width per line so 1 line width total. If we go with 5cm it gives us 22cm total uncertainty.

I don't think it's possible to resolve whether he was offside or not with the technology they have; when the ball hits the Uruguayan players head, the player seems onside, but in the next frame, he seems offside. Is it even possible to know with any certainty  which is correct? If they can't, I think they have to stick with the decision on the field. 


However, I've seen call that were just as marginal reversed, so it just seems to be up to the discretion of the referees?

I'd be curious how egregious this was in terms of where the restart occured. Annecdotally, I see refs being picky about location when the foul was close to goal or if the kicking team tries to move it much closer to goal. This was neither.

So are we going to see PRO being *really* picky about restarts for a few weeks? 

Like I guess Seattle got away with one here, and I'll admit it, but it honestly feels more like the average officiating blunder that just happened to occur right before a goal vs the blunder caused the goal. The ball started in the defensive half which is not a high probability spot, so Colorado should clearly lay some of the blame on their own defending.",weird Especially - PRO nt admit - foul suspect ie likely foul probably bigger goof PRO blew advantage Seattle taking kick far away foul called? argue hardly FK near penalty box moved 20 yards opposite direction d curious egregious terms restart occured Annecdotally refs picky location foul close goal kicking team tries closer goal going PRO ** picky restarts weeks?

I'm sure someone with as much experience as he has could have showed a little more passion with such a ridiculous call, there's not much risk to it. Yet he just told Mulraney to walk it off.

&#x200B;

As for obstructing the keeper. You'll repeatedly hear about the referee's discretion or opinion on this one. Bou was directly in the path of the ball, even if he's not very tall. If he would have been 4 yards further toward the back post the goal would have likely stood. But directly in the path of the ball, that close to both the last play and goal, it is not unreasonable for this to be called offside.

Basically, for an attacking player, it's good advice to move out of an offside position before the ball is played. Lurking around 8 yards in front of goal with no intention to be playing the game, is asking for problems.",laws grey deliberate play vs making save deliberate play usually means player proper control ball quick movement limited contact defender right try stop ball going goal & obstructing keeper ll repeatedly hear referees discretion opinion Bou directly path ball s tall 4 yards post goal likely stood directly path ball close play goal unreasonable called offside & Basically attacking player good advice offside position ball played Lurking 8 yards goal intention playing game asking problems,en,en,2023,MLS

Nichtsdestotrotz sollten wir zum Punkt kommen, das unsere Schiedsrichter auf der einen Seite einfach besser werden und dafür auf der anderen Seite dann auch weniger Kritik abbekommen.

Irren ist Menschlich und die Schiris sind auch Menschen, trotzdem hat man das Gefühl seit dem VAR gibt's mehr Diskussionen um Fehlentscheidungen als vorher, besonders bei klar offensichtlichen Situationen oder fast gleichen Situationen die aber am gleichen Wochenende zum Unterschiedlichen Bewertungen von Schiedsrichtern führen.

Tatsächlich würde ich die ""Challenge"" aber ergänzend zum VAR einbauen, außer wir kommen wieder dahin das die Schiedsrichter ein wirklich gutes Niveau erreichen.

Ich würde sogar soweit gehen und sagen: Reform des VAR's das er nur noch für Grobe Unsportlichkeiten und Abseits da ist, aber nicht mehr für Überprüfungen von Toren oder sonstigem, da kann ein Trainer dann eben immer noch die Challenge ziehen. Besonders deswegen weil Unsportlichkeiten oft mal durch verschiedene ""Tatorte"" auf dem Platz übersehen werden und das Abseits ja ggf. schon ab nächster Saison wie auch in der CL, Halb-automatisch gemacht werden soll.

Denn der VAR wenn er funktioniert ist ja nicht schlecht, nur verlassen sich unsere Spielleiter zu sehr darauf und das kann es nicht sein, besonders auf die angesprochene unterschiedliche Bewertung von gleichen Szenen selbst an einem Spieltag.",Generell erstmal Idee Nichtsdestotrotz Punkt Schiedsrichter Seite einfach Seite Kritik abbekommen Irren Menschlich Schiris Menschen Gefühl VAR gibts Diskussionen Fehlentscheidungen vorher klar offensichtlichen Situationen fast gleichen Situationen gleichen Wochenende Unterschiedlichen Bewertungen Schiedsrichtern führen Tatsächlich Challenge ergänzend VAR einbauen Schiedsrichter Niveau erreichen sogar soweit sagen Reform VARs Grobe Unsportlichkeiten Abseits Überprüfungen Toren sonstigem Trainer Challenge ziehen Unsportlichkeiten mal verschiedene Tatorte Platz übersehen Abseits ggf nächster Saison CL Halb-automatisch VAR funktioniert verlassen Spielleiter angesprochene unterschiedliche Bewertung gleichen Szenen Spieltag,de,de,2024,Bundesliga

- Zeigen der Szene auf den Stadion-Monitoren 

- Häufigeres rausgehen durch den Schiedsrichter, gerade bei strittigen Entscheidungen

Wir gehen von komplett anderen Prinzipien was richtig und falsch bzw überstimmbar ist. 


Das Abseits von St Pauli ist davon beeinflusst das ein Frame bestimmt werden ""muss"", man sich für das best passende Frame entscheidet, das ist aber subjektiv und letztendlich Ermessensspielraum. Die Idee hierbei ist ein 51:49 übers Knie zu brechen. Die Gefahr hierbei ist das an einem anderen Tag einer von 100 das anders sieht und dann daraus 49:51 wird.  
Der VAR ist aber anders konzipiert, er muss nicht entscheiden, im Gegensatz zum Schiri. Der Schiri muss hierbei auch die Fehlentscheidung selber feststellen, der VAR hilft hier nur dabei die Wahrnehmung zu bestätigen. Theoretisch wäre der VAR perfekt für die gelb rote Karte von Karasor gewesen, die Wahrnehmung das der Stuttgarter den Wolfsburger am Knöchel trifft hatte VAR nach Sekunde in Zweifel ziehen können. Das Tah Etikite wirklich aus dem Gleichgewicht bringt zeigt keine Einstellung eindeutig, den Kontakt hat Schiri wahrgenommen, die Bewertung des Kontakts bewertet der Schiri aber nicht neu. Und mit 51:49 Gefühl bei zweiter Ansicht, und wohlmöglich wieder 49:51 bei drittem Blickwinkel, sollte der Schiri auch nichts überstimmen. 
Wenn VAR die Szene komplett isoliert betrachtet soll, der Schiri überstimmen soll wenn Kneipe meint es wäre eher das als das andere brauchen wir keine Challenge. Der VAR muss nur dazu ermächtigt werden. Ich würde dann aber sagen das eine Challenge es dann sogar schlimmer macht. Der VAR sollte dann aber der beste Schiedsrichter sein, nicht der auf dem Feld und auch nicht den die Bayern bezahlen um zu entscheiden ob man die Challenge im Sinne der Bayern nutzt. 
Wenn man es hinbekommt innerhalb von Sekunden das am TV ""richtig"" zu entscheiden, kann man auf den Schiri auf dem Feld komplett verzichten. Warum aber bei 51:49 oder selbst 67:33 Szene sichergestellt sein sollte das der eine VAR immer auf Seiten der ""Mehrheit"" steht weiss ich nicht. 


Das nervigste neben dem Zeitverlust ist die fehlenden Transparenz, und den 49, die sich wohlmöglich sogar noch in der Mehrheit wähnen, die Entscheidung erklären müsste man Ende trotzdem. Die Kommunikation zwischen Schiri und VAR sollte man veröffentlichen, die Entscheidung und auch Notwendigkeiten der Regeln könnte man am Folgetag erklären. Knut Kirchner kann nicht der sprachgewandteste der Zunft sein, als das es unmöglich sein sollte das zu vermitteln. Stürmer müssen sich auch anhören das sie besser in die andere Ecke geschossen hätte sollen, social Media tritt es doch eh so breit, womit ein offizielles Statement "" hätte es lieber anders entschieden gesehen"" doch kaum die Schiri mehr jucken sollte. 


Auf Entscheidung 3min warten zu müssen, weil es knapp war und man es sich zumindest hätte Mal ansehen solle, es ja so viel wichtiger ist wie am Anfang des Spiel oder man hat halt noch eine Challenge frei hat, habe ich keine Lust. Persönlich würde ich es zeitlich begrenzen. Das am nächsten Tag ein Handy Video eine Fehlentscheidung zeigt, oder wegen mir die Schiri Show am Montag, ist mir egal. Die Frage wäre dann eher wie man beim nächsten Mal den VAR es sehen lassen könnte und wenn Kameraperspektive aus der Latte hilfreich wäre kann man das ja machen. Wenn die TV Regie bessere Blickwinkel in den x Sekunden den Zuschauern liefert als dem VAR , wäre ja klar wo VAR hinschauen sollte. Ansonsten sollte es auch egal sein. Die Notwendigkeit ergibt sich eh nur aus der TV Übertragungen, das man im Stadion schon vor Ausführung des Eckball per Textnachrichten mehr weiß wie der Schiri. Umso schlimmer wenn es dem Schiri sogar verschwiegen werden muß. ",Einfach Bildschirm zwingen bringt Schiri luftleeren Raum neu bewertet komplett Prinzipien falsch bzw überstimmbar Abseits St Pauli beeinflusst Frame bestimmt best passende Frame entscheidet subjektiv letztendlich Ermessensspielraum Idee hierbei 5149 übers Knie brechen Gefahr hierbei 100 sieht 4951 VAR konzipiert entscheiden Gegensatz Schiri Schiri hierbei Fehlentscheidung selber feststellen VAR hilft Wahrnehmung bestätigen Theoretisch VAR perfekt gelb rote Karte Karasor Wahrnehmung Stuttgarter Wolfsburger Knöchel trifft VAR Sekunde Zweifel ziehen Tah Etikite Gleichgewicht bringt zeigt Einstellung eindeutig Kontakt Schiri wahrgenommen Bewertung Kontakts bewertet Schiri neu 5149 Gefühl Ansicht wohlmöglich 4951 drittem Blickwinkel Schiri überstimmen VAR Szene komplett isoliert betrachtet Schiri überstimmen Kneipe meint eher brauchen Challenge VAR ermächtigt sagen Challenge sogar schlimmer VAR beste Schiedsrichter Feld Bayern bezahlen entscheiden Challenge Sinne Bayern nutzt hinbekommt innerhalb Sekunden TV entscheiden Schiri Feld komplett verzichten 5149 6733 Szene sichergestellt VAR Seiten Mehrheit steht weiss nervigste Zeitverlust fehlenden Transparenz 49 wohlmöglich sogar Mehrheit wähnen Entscheidung erklären müsste Kommunikation Schiri VAR veröffentlichen Entscheidung Notwendigkeiten Regeln Folgetag erklären Knut Kirchner sprachgewandteste Zunft unmöglich vermitteln Stürmer anhören Ecke geschossen social Media tritt eh breit womit offizielles Statement  entschieden gesehen Schiri jucken Entscheidung 3min warten knapp zumindest Mal ansehen solle wichtiger Anfang Spiel halt Challenge frei Lust Persönlich zeitlich begrenzen nächsten Handy Video Fehlentscheidung zeigt Schiri Show Montag egal Frage eher nächsten Mal VAR sehen lassen Kameraperspektive Latte hilfreich TV Regie bessere Blickwinkel x Sekunden Zuschauern liefert VAR  klar VAR hinschauen Ansonsten egal Notwendigkeit ergibt eh TV Übertragungen Stadion Ausführung Eckball per Textnachrichten weiß Schiri Umso schlimmer Schiri sogar verschwiegen ,de,de,2024,Bundesliga

Danach musste ich wegen einer Erkrankung leider aufhören Spiele zu leiten. 

Der DFB weigert sich eine Kardinalfrage zu beantworten: Warum haben wir in Deutschland keine Profischiedsrichter. Es mag irgendwie romantisch sein, dass Versicherungskaufleute, ein Lehrer oder diverse Mediziner es bis zur WM geschafft haben. Schiedsrichter dieser Klassen sind Hochleistungssportler und ich habe Schiedsrichterkollegen erlebt, die mit dem Jahresurlaub durch die Saison geplant haben. Hier beißt sich der Hund in den Schwanz. 

Es muss eine gewisse Öffnung geben, die DFB Schiedsrichter GmbH benimmt sich immer wieder als wäre sie der Schiedsrichtersportkreis Fichtelgebirge. Zu einer Sache können die Kollegen, die heute an der Front sind aber nichts, die Fußballregelhüter haben den Sport weitgehend kaputtreguliert. Als ich damals meine Prüfung ablegte kam mein Regelbuch mit zwei Seiten zum Handspiel aus. Dort wurde erklärt was nun strafbar ist und was eben nicht. Heute ist die Handspielregel schwerer als biologische Physik. 

Ich halte die Idee des Videoschiedsrichters an sich für falsch. Wenn ich zwei oder drei Leute mehrere Autostunden von einem Spielort platziere, haben sie Bildschirme, das ist aseptisch. Das macht es künstlich und am Ende weiß ich, dass die Kniescheibe im Abseits war und mit dieser kann ein Tor erzielt werden. Der Schiedsrichter und sein Gespann ist am Geschehen, nimmt ein Spiel war und kann daher wesentlich besser urteilen. 

Mein Lieblingsbeispiel: Die persönliche Strafe nach einem Foulspiel. Nach der 12 Wiederholung sieht fast jeder Körperkontakt, im Regelbuch heißt es noch immer, dass dieser Körperkontakt zum Spiel gehört, fast zum offenen Knochenbruch geführt hat. Im realen Spieltempo ist der Zweikampf, den ich im Spiel A mit einem Freistoß ahnden kann auch deswegen richtig, weil er in die Dynamik des Spiels passt. Beim Spiel B muss ich hier vielleicht zwingend noch eine persönliche Strafe aussprechen, weil das Spiel eher nickelig ist und ich weniger Leine lassen kann. Diese Freiheit wird dem Schiedsrichter genommen, was ich wahnsinnig bedauerlich finde.

Mein letzter Gedanke ist ein Quervergleich: Im Profiboxen beschloss einer der fünf großen Verbände, dass nach Runde vier und Runde acht die Punktstände bekannt gegeben werden, was zu mehr Transparenz führen sollte. In Wahrheit hat es den Sport geschadet, weil die Luft raus war. Ich wusste zur achten Runde, dass der Kampf nicht mehr unentschieden ausgehen kann oder unterlegene Boxer noch aufholt und mit ein bisschen Erfahrung weiß man dann auch wer nun in Führung liegt. Sport ist keine Wissenschaft.

In meinem Schiedsrichterunterlagen schrieb mein Landesverband in einer Broschüre, dass Fußball wegen seiner Einfachheit so beliebt wurde. Dahin sollte der Fußball sich zurückentwickeln.

Nur so, wie es jetzt ist, nervt es nur noch. 
Vor jeder Saison wird angekündigt, dass jetzt alles klarer werden soll und jede Saison steigt man weniger durch. An der einen Stelle greift er ein, bei gleicher Situation an anderer Stelle nicht. Was eine klare Fehlentscheidung ist liegt ebenfalls im jeweiligen Ermessensspielraum. Dazu kommt noch eine Handspielregelung, die von Spiel zu Spiel anders ausgelegt wird. Dabei lässt sich alles von den Fachmännern begründen, wie auch im Spiel gegen Spanien. Und warum geht der Schiri nicht gleich raus und guckt sich die Bilder so wie sie vom VAR ausgegeben werden mit an. Warum muss der erst 3 Minuten aufm Platz stehen, um dann zum Monitor zu joggen. Und wenn der VAR nur bei klaren Fehlentscheidungen eingreift, warum muss er überhaupt die Szene noch 80 Mal schauen. Dann reicht doch der Hinweis, dass die Entscheidung falsch war. Wenn es Ermessensspielraum gibt, dann ist es keine klare Fehlentscheidung.

Wo wir moderne Technik benötigen ist Abseits, auch wenn ich der Meinung bin, dass diese Milimeterentscheidungen auch quatsch sind, vor allem solange nicht der Kontakt zum Ball, wie bei der EM genau gemessen wird. Ich weiß das Spiel nicht mehr, aber beim vorletzten Spieltag, waren zumindest die Fernsehbilder mit der Abseitslinie so gezogen, dass der Kontakt zum Ball 1-2 Frames später war, als die Linie gezogen wurde. Aber wenn wir so Entscheidungen wie bei Union haben, wo man mit dem Auge kein Abseits mehr erkennen kann, dann muss auch der Zeitpunkt des Abspielens absolut genau erfasst werden.

First I will look into the promises that were made before VAR was introduced.

1 Football will be more just.
This is somewhat true. There are wrong decisions, which are corrected. 
However the VAR also creates and increased a „feeling of injustice”. What used to be a mistake by one person made in split second is now the ref making a mistake, then 4 people spend minutes to look at it from every single angle of the scene and then confirm the mistake. Also you don’t understand why the referee goes to the monitor sometimes and sometimes not, but I will get to that.

2 The referees will gain authority and there will be less discussions
This couldn’t be further from the truth. There are still discussions every week after three years. The linesmen don’t dare to lift the flag even if someone’s 5 meters offside. To me it also seems like the refs whistle less, because they rely on VAR to correct them. But the problem is that VAR only corrects when there is a ”clear“ error which is not the case then. And don’t get me started on the players, all they do now is calling on the referee to check something and the more they do it, the more time VAR gets to check it. So it is even rewarded.

3 Checks will take less and less time
I just don’t see it. This shit still takes ages and robs the flow of any game. Obviously it is the worst for fans in attendance, as you have absolutely no clue what is happening. But it‘s not like the clubs rely on revenue from fans visiting the mat... Oh wait, they do. Yet there wasn’t a single decision in years to benefit fans in the stadiums. Hopefully the clubs get reminded through Corona that they just can’t survive without fans! But hey, they still got the asian market.

To me the VAR is totally random and willkürlich. Why is the referee going to the monitor sometimes and other times not, why are the times on the checks so different. What is a ”silent check” and when is it used? If there is a foul in the creation of a goal, how short before the goal does it have to be, so it can still be checked? Why aren’t Yellow-red cards checked, as they are also a Platzverweis.
Also to me the VAR behaves like a wild bear, there a matchdays, were it goes into a blind rage and checks and overturned everything, then there comes a time, were it goes into hibernation. We are currently in a sleeping phase were the VAR does nothing or does it wrong. The last seven sequences happened in less than 40 days.

Also, also I just don’t get IFAB. First they don’t want to change the rules for years and don’t get goal-line technology into the rulebook. Now they include VAR which adds nothing to the game and mess with the hand rule every season.

Although I think the war on VAR is already lost I just don’t want to give up hope just yet.

Compilation wrong decisions despite VAR German commentary,"For 1) I am pretty sure that all the statistics point to less wrong decisions. Yeah it's even more infuriating when the decision is wrong and not corrected by the VAR, but it usually means that the decision would have been wrong either way. It is *very* rare that the ref changes the call from right to wrong after VAR involvement. Although that seems to be untrue, it simply is selection bias - it sticks to your memory a lot more.

2) was a BS argument from the beginning, everybody knows that football is a game of passion and there *will* be discussions, no matter what.

3) I can neither confirm nor deny, but in my book it is basically irrelevant. I don't have a problem with 20-30 seconds between a situation and the check to complete.. I don't feel it interrupts the flow a lot, but YMMV.

The (perceived and actual) randomness of On-Field Reviews (OFRs) is due to the refs calls. No one can force a ref to an OFR, he or she decides all by themselves. It is inherently random since the perception of the ref is the deciding factor. If the VAR asks the ref ""have you noticed a contact of the left feet?"" and the ref says ""yeah, that was not enough"", there is no OFR, if he says ""what? No!"" that's an error in perception and the ref would be an idiot and at fault not to take the opportunity for an OFR. But that is probably a lot less dependent on the VAR than on the on-field ref.. (see below)

I agree that IFAB fucked up with the hand rule. They simply cannot find a way to make it ""easy"" to decide and therefore avoid different calls in very similar situations.. But it is quite the hard task to make a perfect rule. If it was completely and categorically forbidden to touch the ball with the whole arm, that would lead to silly situations nobody wants penalties for and still leaves the question ""arm or shoulder/back/chest?"" for debate...

My main point is the transparency. How was the decision really made? That is somewhat helped by releasing the communications between ref and VAR, but I get that such a step could potentially undermine the refs and some of them don't feel too comfortable with this idea.

In the end, it is a game played by humans with humans deciding and humans err. I don't see why we would be better off without the VAR.",1 pretty sure statistics point wrong decisions Yeah infuriating decision wrong corrected VAR usually means decision wrong way ** rare ref changes right wrong VAR involvement untrue simply selection bias - sticks memory lot 2 BS argument beginning everybody knows football game passion ** discussions matter 3 confirm deny book basically irrelevant nt problem 20-30 seconds situation check complete nt feel interrupts flow lot YMMV perceived actual randomness -Field Reviews OFRs refs calls force ref OFR decides inherently random perception ref deciding factor VAR asks ref noticed contact left feet? ref says yeah OFR says ? ! s error perception ref idiot fault opportunity OFR probably lot dependent VAR -field ref agree IFAB fucked hand rule simply find way easy decide avoid different calls similar situations hard task perfect rule completely categorically forbidden touch ball arm lead silly situations wants penalties leaves question arm shoulder//chest? debate main point transparency decision ? somewhat helped releasing communications ref VAR step potentially undermine refs nt feel comfortable idea end game played humans humans deciding humans err nt better VAR,en,en,2021,Bundesliga

3116,kpk45w,ghy1ye3,[Kicker] Error by the VAR: How Hoffenheim conceded a penalty for a handball without hand or arm contact,Kicker Error VAR Hoffenheim conceded penalty handball hand arm contact,"Translation:

Referees wrongly penalized Hoffenheim in match against Freiburg:

A handball penalty that seemed clear at first glance before Freiburg scored 2-0 in a 3-1 win at Hoffenheim turned out to be a mistake when watching a slow-motion video provided by ARD (german TV station). Although the ball touched neither hand nor arm, the VAR-team did not correct referee Robert Hartmann.

Admittedly, it was a tricky scene that the referee team around Robert Hartmann had to clarify in the match between Hoffenheim and Freiburg (1:3). And at first, no one in the stadium could seriously disagree when the referee suddenly decided on a handball penalty for SC Freiburg after 33 minutes. Surprisingly, even the player involved spared serious protests.

After the visitors had taken a corner kick at the near post, Nicolas Höfler had extended the ball and headed at Melayro Bogarde, who was positioned directly behind him. The Dutchman held his arms unnecessarily and unnaturally at chin height, probably for his own protection. The slightly altered trajectory of the ball betrayed a body contact. Hartmann attributed this to Bogarde's right arm. So punishable handball in the penalty area - Vincenzo Grifo converted the subsequent penalty safely.

Wrong decision: Hand penalty without hand or arm contact

But as later pictures on ARD's ""Sportschau"" showed, Bogarde had just turned away in time and brought his arms out of the line of fire, but touched the ball lightly with his face in the area of his nose. The slow-motion images, supported by a magnifying glass function, clearly clarify the situation. It was therefore a hand penalty without hand or arm contact - a wrong decision. At this point, the question arises why the specialists in the video assist center in Cologne around VAR Guido Winkmann and VAR assistant Christian Bandurski did not manage to come to the same and correct conclusion.

Especially bitter for Hoffenheim: It was the trend-setting 2:0 for Freiburg after 34 minutes, i.e. a game-deciding scene. For the currently long-suffering Hoffenheim coach Sebastian Hoeneß, who at this point already had two freshly injured players to mourn, the wrong decision fit the picture. ""I already had this thought, too,"" the 38-year-old explained when he learned about the unmasking TV images in an ARD interview shortly after the final whistle. In this case, however, the clarification came much too late and, moreover, not from the body responsible for it in the game from Cologne.

Oft gibt's ja die Diskussion rund um: Ja aber hat der Spieler denn da wirklich Schmerzen so dass er sich 5x rollen muss etc., aber das hier ist ja ganz klar und vor allem passiert sowas bei vielen Spielern.

There is not enough room in this article to list all the oddities of the lawsuit [against Dortmund fans who had shouted ""Hopp, you son of a bitch"" during the 2017/18 season]. The efforts taken by the investigators before suing the Dortmund fans were bizarre; a case officer spent a total of six weeks analysing video footage. The court refused to question Hopp as a witness; there wasn't even Hopp's official address in the files, so - in a hilariously smug gesture - the defending lawyers send their summons to Hopp's golf club.

But whats the realistic position here? I have to deal a lot with the 3 lowest leagues in my region. It basically happens every year, or at least 2 years, that among the plus minus 50 clubs in the district is one where suddenly a local entrepreneur (like car dealer, construction company, or so) enters the scene and wants to push his club up. They pour money in the clubs (sometimes even hire players into their company), get new players and often this indeed results that the team will get up 1-3 leagues. Unlike Hopp, they have not the funds and not the patience to get them higher. Indeed, such investors get quickly disappointed and often enough a team rises and falls apart in 4 years.

(You couldn't get away with it as much in the prem cause everyone and their mother would be arguing letter of the law for every little incident imo) That being said, it clearly states that an incident in which a foul may have been committed inside the box should be checked for VAR and from that 
""The VAR can only give their opinion. The match referee has three options when they hear what their colleague has to say:

Leave their decision unchanged.
Accept the VAR's suggestion regarding a decision.
Watch the incident again themselves via a TV screen inside the stadium.""

Now, the incident in question wasn't even checked on VAR, which for me, is the key problem. If you're going to use VAR, you should be consistent. 

Now on to the question of if it's a pen or not. 

The handball rules used in the Bundesliga are actually nicely available on their website and the rule about natural positions that I believe you're referencing isn't mentioned. These are the rules that correlate with not giving a handball due to natural position. 

""if a player is falling and the ball touches their hand/arm when it is between their body and the ground to support the body (but not extended to make the body bigger)""
""the ball touches a player’s hand/arm which is close to their body and has not made their body unnaturally bigger""

HOWEVER --  the rule specifically states that these will not result in a foul UNLESS the situation fits one of these --

""a ball touches a player’s hand/arm which has made their body unnaturally bigger
the ball touches a player’s hand/arm when it is above their shoulder (unless the player has deliberately played the ball which then touches their hand/arm)""

Now, I'm not sure how they'd feel about the 2nd since he was on the ground, but rules as written his body was both in an unnatural position and it touched his arm when it was above his shoulder. Both of which supercede the rules that would protect against the pen. 

So based upon the rules the on the official bundesliga website, if the ref didn't see it, VAR should've still checked, and realistically, suggested a pen.

Roma-Monza, step on foot on Baldanzi, probably one of the most clear fouls I've seen this year - not called but surely reviewed.


The fact that it wasn't awarded has to go in the ""call against the club"" even it was a mistake.

Even the Thuram Pavlovic contact from the derby must be considered as a decision in favor of Milan.


If this only takes into account when a VAR check is ""officially called"" and the referee has to go and watch the action back, I can't help but to feel like this list is absolutely useless.

DiMarco should’ve 1000% been sent off, whoever says the opposite is lying to themselves, he goes nowhere near the ball and genuinely endangers Bonaventura. Now, in my opinion, it should be a red card but not a penalty because it doesn’t deny a clear goal scoring opportunity, since Jack had already kicked the ball at this point, but I am aware that the rules say that it has to be a penalty. So correct call probably would’ve been penalty + red card.
Regarding the penalty for Inter, in my opinion that’s a pen. I don’t think saying it shouldn’t have been a penalty because in the Roma game it wasn’t assigned is a good excuse, because you could say the same thing but backwards.

Actual VAR, used how it should be, would only elevate the sport. It's one of those things that should be there for blatant handballs but instead is used for mm offside calls.  

The time it takes is awful and the stuff it's limited to changing is wank. It's not hard for someone to watch replays real time and say ""Oi that wasn't a corner, it richoceted back off the attacker, give a goal kick"" and the ref changes it to a goal kick.

But if course we have to protect on field refs egos; they aren't allowed to be wrong. So VAR just stays quiet so the ref can double down.

I also get that VAR has spoiled the match day experience to a degree, but like, if you celebrate a goal and it gets cancelled by VAR, it's a goal that didn't deserve to stand and should be chalked off. If a goal goes in celebrate until you are told otherwise, that's what I do. Seems silly to sit on your hands because you don't know if it's counted or not. If the Var check passes, then you can celebrate a second time. How many goals go in that stand, compared to those that get pulled back by VAR? Barely any are actually denied by VAR in comparison. And if VAR is used correctly, then they are goals that don't deserve to stand.",problem VAR seen likes Prem shitly wank officials garbage job Actual VAR elevate sport things blatant handballs instead mm offside calls time takes awful stuff limited changing wank hard watch replays real time Oi nt corner richoceted attacker goal kick ref changes goal kick course protect field refs egos nt allowed wrong VAR stays quiet ref double VAR spoiled match day experience degree like celebrate goal gets cancelled VAR goal nt deserve stand chalked goal goes celebrate told s silly sit hands nt know counted Var check passes celebrate second time goals stand compared pulled VAR?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Championship/comments/12s9ppf/blackburn_rovers_11_coventry_city_down_10_in_the/jgxkclv/

But a lot of the anger has been directed at their team for a very good reason. Until the last twenty minutes or so they were dominant. At half time they had 70% of the possession and Coventry hadn’t had a single shot, on or off target. Coventry were terrible for the vast majority of the game and Blackburn really, really should have put the game to bed. But they failed at that and it seems this isn’t the first time. Eventually they gave up trying and went the time wasting route instead (there were a ridiculous amount of ‘injuries’ in the last twenty minutes or so). And in doing so they let Coventry back into the game, to the point that they were pretty rampant towards the end.

So yeah, I think their anger at that overpowers their anger at the ref. And let’s not forget that the same referee failed to send a Blackburn player off for a second yellow after he did a flying kick on Panzo (he even wanted to give the free kick to Blackburn until the assistant corrected him), so if they want to complain about the ref they are going to have to deal with that first.",accepting match thread example lot anger directed team good reason minutes dominant half time 70% possession Coventry single shot target Coventry terrible vast majority game Blackburn game bed failed time Eventually gave trying went time wasting route instead ridiculous ‘injuries’ minutes let Coventry game point pretty rampant end yeah think anger overpowers anger ref letforget referee failed send Blackburn player second yellow flying kick Panzo wanted free kick Blackburn assistant corrected want complain ref going deal ,en,en,2023,Championship

Clear and obvious lost its meaning the second it came into play. Offside by an ear is bullshit, that is not an advantage and VAR giving that instead of a regular linesman sucks the “benefit of the doubt to the attacker” out of the game (the game which is about entertainment).

Did these referees ever pass fucking GCSE maths to know the 6 yard box is a rectangle and that the lines are straight?

Our defense is incredible, but we have faced some inefficient attacks that should have put goals past us. Opportunities that Prem strikers can take. Then going forward we have no real consistency.

But it really means we just lack creativity against stout defenses.

I think Parker was given a dud deal tbf, he arrived to the best squad in the league was playing great counter attacking football which we won 5-0 and 4-1 due to pace and quality. The squad got gutted in front of his eyes so he had to change tact. The following few months of building a strong defense and base makes sense from that point.

Championship clubs fighting for promotion have all been offered the option of video assistant referees for the semi-finals and final, and it is understood the response has proved overwhelmingly positive.

While Var is used in the Premier League, and later stages of the FA Cup and League Cup, it has never been trialled in the Championship before, but the EFL believe it will be crucial with so much at stake.

It was estimated last year that promotion to the Premier League can be worth up to £195 million, with Fulham and Bournemouth both clinching their returns to the top division.

Nottingham Forest, Huddersfield Town, Sheffield United, Luton Town, Middlesbrough and Millwall are the six clubs in contention to secure four of the play-off places in Saturday's final league match of the season.

At Thursday's EFL board meeting, the proposal to use Var in the crunch matches later this month was offered to those clubs.

With many Championship clubs frustrated this season over refereeing decisions which they argue has cost them points - most recently in Forest's defeat at Bournemouth on Tuesday night - the chances of Var being introduced are very high.

Forest were controversially denied a penalty when Sam Surridge, the forward, was wrongly adjudged to be offside before he was brought down by goalkeeper Mark Travers as he tried to round him in the first half.
Steve Cooper, the Forest head coach, revealed after the game that referee Stuart Attwell and his assistant had apologised and admitted it was an incorrect decision.

“When the referee asked to see me and apologised, held his hands up, it doesn’t make it any better,"" he said. ""They’ve owned up to a huge error. 

“It won’t soften me up. These things need to be reported correctly, which we do. There’s a lot of annoyance at that. We’ll get back, reflect and keep going.”

Var reviews all goals, straight red cards, penalty-kick awards and every potential mistaken identity scenario, and has been used in English football since the 2018 FA Cup and then the 2019/20 Premier League campaign onwards.

Horrible game of football and I was a bag of nerves through out. We never really got out of second gear but got the job done. I didn't think the Colback incident was a penalty but the Lowe one, that was bang on and if I was Huddersfield, i'd feel mugged by VAR. That said, I look at the referee shafting us at Bournemouth when Surridge should have had a penalty and think that it's evened out.

Given Luton's tiny budget, where Huddersfield finished last season and where we were after seven games, the fact we were in the Playoffs in the first place is incredible.

Not being used when it perhaps should have been, being used when there was no need for it, goals disallowed because a player’s stud was offside… and at the expense of a game being slowed down for a few minutes while no-one in the stadium has any idea what’s going on. It ruins celebrating goals as well, which is literally the best part of football. 

My only personal experience of it with a team I follow is with England, and it really mutes the goal celebration because you know some bellend is off in a windowless room working out if one pixel of Raheem Sterling’s nipple was offside. One of the things I love about supporting a lower league side (and a reason I’m actually not that bothered about Pompey getting promoted back to the prem) is that we don’t have to deal with all that bollocks.

* Only the captains should be allowed to approach the ref unless he invites other players to do so. Moaning in the face of the ref should be a yellow card. Touching the ref a red.

* A foul is a foul no matter where on the pitch it occurs. A light shoulder barge which isn't a foul outside the penalty box should not be punished inside it.
* All grounds should be required to sell reasonably priced pies.
* I'm OK with beer not being allowed in the main part of the stadium. Much as I like the idea of sitting to watch football with a beer, it would get annoying having people walking past every five minutes because they need a piss.

* Each club should have a body elected by fans which has a veto over badge or kit changes.

En touchant sa jambe, le défenseur va involontairement contrarier ses appuis dans un moment où il aurait pu sinon frapper au but. Le plongeon à retardement est bien sûr ridicule, mais le fait de ne pas donner un penalty le serait autant.

Pour le constat initial, l'arbitre n'ayant pas suivi la VAR je ne vois pas comment on peut dire que cela prends trop d'importance. Au contraire, j'ai tendance à trouver que la VAR en général n'est pas assez suivie ou écoutée, et je suis bien content quand un but refusé pour hors-jeu est finalement accordé parce que l'attaquant est couvert de façon pas immédiatement évidente pour l'arbitre de ligne. Autant je suis prêt à ce que les actions soient arrêtées plus tôt quand le hors jeu est flagrant, autant les parties sont maintenant moins hachées par des hors-jeu imaginaires sifflés toutes les cinq minutes. Très souvent dans les cas litigieux l'attaque ne va pas au bout, et l'on ne revient pas sur le hors-jeu, ce qui fait des parties plus fluides.

Bref, je trouve que les cris sur la VAR sont improductifs, et je préfère discuter d'améliorations possibles de la VAR. A commencer par des suspensions après match, comme au rugby. Si Konaté prends un rouge a posteriori sur sa poussette sur Barcola, il ne joue pas au match retour. Si un plongeon manifeste sans contact est signalé après match, on peut imaginer des cartons jaunes. Avec la suspension pour trois cartons, les joueurs qui en abusent seraient vite calmés.

Bref, je suis plutôt pour les améliorations qui apaisent les débats (comme la goal line tech), même si comme pour toute décision il y a toujours des cas litigieux.

##Résumés :

- US Orléans 2 - 3 MINITEL FC.

Ce match était sur le papier à l'avantage de l'US Orléans : à domicile, un MINITEL FC. sans aucune victoire et une défaite à seulement un but d'écart contre le PSV Heineken la journée précédente. Mais une équipe déterminée du MINITEL FC. a permis d'inverser la tendance et de montrer que leur première journée désastreuse n'est qu'un lointain souvenir. L'abnégation des joueurs du MINITEL, la pauvreté offensive de l'USO et le penalty manqué d'Umut Bozok ont donc eu raison de cette équipe. Un formidable résultat pour le MINITEL qui, même si elle n'a pas beaucoup de profondeur (3 joueurs sur le banc et 1 Rotaldo) montre qu'elle a suffisamment de qualité pour jouer avec les meillleurs. Le match retour contre le PSV Heineken annonce d'être très intéressant. Buts signés Sala pour l'USO et Le Tallec, Neymar et Aouar (MPG) pour le MINITEL.

Homme du match : Le Tallec (MINITEL FC.) : **7.5**

- La Boucherie Sanzot 3 - 5 PSV Heineken

Une chose est sûre, le PSV Heineken est bien parti pour boire la concurrence jusqu'à la toute fin du championnat. L'équipe s'impose pour la 3e fois en autant de matchs au stade ""Loulou"" avec encore une fois la manière. Ni l'argent glissé sous la veste de l'arbitre par /u/Dismael, ni les nombreux buts inscrits par la Boucherie n'auront été suffisants pour revenir totalement au score face à une féroce équipe d'Heineken. Les buts sont signés Lala, Gradel et Selnaes(MPG) pour La Boucherie ainsi que Gnahore, Payet, Cabella et Cavani (x2) pour PSV Heineken, le but de Kamano ayant été refusé après un hors-jeu pas des plus évidents.

Homme du match : Cavani (PSV Heineken) : **7.5**

Le communiqué de Marseille est vraiment une belle blague, Eyraud est encore une fois à côté de la plaque.

Marseille était supérieur tactiquement, dans l'état d'esprit, et dans l'intensité, et méritait de gagner ce match c'est certain.

Le tifo était incroyable, les fumigènes étaient magnifiques, et l'ambiance était digne des 120 ans (aucune idée d'où vient l'animosité par contre, ou l'importance du match pour les marseillais depuis quelques années, mais bon).

Par contre, il y a des trucs inadmissibles qui se sont passés pendant ce match et avant. Le caillassage du bus, qui s'il avait été banalisé n'aurait probablement pas eu de double vitrage et les joueurs auraient été en danger. Les joueurs qui ne peuvent pas tiré un corner sans protection de la police avec un bouclier à cause de ""fans"" abrutis. Les ramasseurs de balle qui ne rendent pas le ballon et cherchent à gagner du temps (sérieux j'ai jamais vu ça depuis 15 ans que je regarde du foot, même dans une demi finale de ligue des champions ou dans un derby).

Tout ça participe à une ambiance malsaine. Accentué par la mauvaise agressivité des marseillais, notamment dans les dernières minutes, et sur un minot en plus. Et j'en veux pas vraiment à l'arbitre pour les erreurs d'arbitrage ça doit être compliqué d'officier dans ces conditions là. Eyraud par contre ne se grandit vraiment pas en ne condamnant pas ni les projectiles, ~~ni les tarés qui caillassent le bus~~. Il va même jusqu'à dire que c'est de la faute des lyonnais dans son communiqué. 

Maintenant oui il y eu des erreurs d'arbitrage, et la plus grosse pour moi n'est pas le penalty, même s'il pose question. C'est la claque de Benedetto, qui n'importe quelle intensité réelle qu'elle soit, ne doit pas exister sur un terrain de foot et est punie d'un rouge sur 98% des matchs. Que le joueur qui la reçoit simule ou non. Oui Dubois en fait trop, mais ce n'est pas la question.

Si ne serait ce qu'un dixième de ce qu'il s'est passé dimanche s'était passé à Lyon, on sait tous que les réactions seraient bien différentes.

Mea culpa sur ce coup là, j'avais lu le communiqué en diagonale et j'avais pas vu cette phrase là. Il ne condamne pas par contre les événements sur les corners.

>Tu bases sur quoi pour annoncer que les bus banalisés n'ont pas de double vitrage ? Personnellement je n'en sais rien mais ça m'étonnerait que les marseillais montent jouer à Paris sans un bus à double vitrage.

Sur ce que les lyonnais avaient dit, et ce qu'ils viennent de dire encore dans leur communiqué. J'ai du mal à imaginer qu'ils mentent la dessus vu que ça serait assez vite vérifiable pour les médias.

>Et à quel moment il y a eu de la ""mauvaise agressivité"" de la part des marseillais ?

Je parlais principalement de la fin de match, et du traitement réservé à Cherki qui a à peine 16 ans et qu'ils ont tombé durement plusieurs fois. Je suis entièrement d'accord pour dire que l'intensité était marseillaise, je l'ai même dit dans mon premier commentaire.

On voit pas grand chose sur les ralentis qu'ils ont montré, mais ça part quand même bien vite pour appleler ça une tape. Ça aurait vraiment pas été scandaleux qu'il prenne un rouge, et Dubois un jaune oui probablement.

>Ce qui est véritablement inadmissible par contre c'est l'intervention de Garibian qui désavoue publiquement un de ses arbitres. C'est un truc qui n'est jamais arrivé de mémoire (d'habitude la DTA protège ses arbitres). Et là bizarrement quand ça touche JMA et le club de Lyon il monte au créneau .. Pitoyable. On sait que l'ami Jean-Michel a une forte pression dans les hautes sphères du foot français mais là ça crève les yeux.

Voilà. La on touche le cœur du problème et la raison de mon commentaire et de mon incrédulité sur la plupart des réactions. On est au lendemain d'un match où l'OM a clairement été avantagé par l'arbitrage (et donc L'OL désavantagé), et vous (les marseillais et les anti-lyonnais en général) réussissez quand même à agir en victime et à parler d'un soi disant favoritisme des instances et d'une connivence de JMA avec les arbitres. Je veux bien que vous haissez JMA, aucun soucis avec ça, c'est pas nouveau que sa réussite rend jaloux, mais là faut vraiment avoir un soucis. Garibian intervient dans le cadre d'un ""séminaire"" sur la VAR où sont invités tous les médias de France (même FootMercato a fait un article dessus et sur leur présence) et où il fait une sorte de premier bilan. Au lendemain de ce match, avec une erreur manifeste sur une nouvelle règle appliquée seulement cette saison, les mains offensives. Donc il précise la règle pour que tous les journalistes (dont l'Equipe) puisse la prochaine fois la connaître et éviter de dire et d'écrire des âneries. Ils l'aurait fait dans le même cas si l'action avait été inversée, et il l'aurait aussi fait si le match avait été un Rennes-Nantes ou n'importe quelle autre affiche du dimanche soir avec la même action.

Je vois pas en quoi l'âge de Cherki est un argument ici, tu peux pas demander aux adversaires de lever le pied car il a 16 ans ! (je dirais même que ses adversaires devraient profiter du fait qu'il soit plus frêle pour le ""bouffer"" physiquement, sans chercher à lui casser un genou évidemment).

&#x200B;

> On est au lendemain d'un match où l'OM a clairement été avantagé par l'arbitrage 

Je veux bien admettre que certaines situations ont tournées à notre avantage (je suis d'accord avec toi le rouge pour Benedetto n'aurait pas été un scandale, un jaune non plus). Mais de là à dire qu'on a été CLAIREMENT avantagé, t'y vas fort. 

Je n'oublie pas les simulations de JRA (fin de première mi-temps) et d'Aouar (en début de deuxième, là où il se blesse) qui se laissent tomber dans la surface marseillaise et qui ne sont pas sanctionnés.

&#x200B;

> et vous (les marseillais et les anti-lyonnais en général) réussissez quand même à agir en victime 

C'est une blague ? Le seul à agir en victime ici c'est Jean-Michel ""ouin-ouin"" Aulas qui crie au scandale depuis le coup de sifflet final (en direct après le match sur le plateau du CFC) et sans discontinuité sur Twitter. Nous on s'étonne juste de l'intervention de Garibian.

4929,1hasv6m,m1bpswj,VAR Audio from yesterday’s Penalty Call ,VAR Audio yesterdayPenalty ,"This is incredible lol the America players are off their line at the kick off and it’s a clear encroachment. I’d like to question why the VAR didn’t review it from the start of the original play, which was 10 seconds before where they had it paused at. Calling a penalty is clearly discretionary, and I can live with that. However, what is the point of the VAR if we’re not going to utilize it correctly? The way they, in the booth, confidently call the penalty, yet don’t think to scrutinize other plays eligible for review (like the foul on Toro Fernández at the 88th), makes me really question their ability to use the VAR. 

In a game where referee official’s decisions, or lack there of, directly impact a game in its crucial moments, you really want to believe the referees utilize this new innovative technology to the best of their ability. This is where my personal frustration and strife comes with this game. Yes Cruz azul made horrid mistakes that cost us the first two goals, and yes we had a lame first half, but we made up for it. We absolutely did. Every single time our hope got shot down by America, we found a way to pick it up immediately and fire back con huevos. I invite every other team from the league this season to be in that predicament and do what we did, I assure you the result won’t be the same. That is why it’s disappointing to know that the final nail in our coffin came from a decision that’s a matter of circumstance and perception. 

It is what it is.",incredible lol America players line kick clear encroachment like question VAR review start original play 10 seconds paused Calling penalty clearly discretionary live point VAR going utilize correctly? way booth confidently penalty think scrutinize plays eligible review like foul Toro Fernández 88th makes question ability use VAR game referee officialdecisions lack directly impact game crucial moments want believe referees utilize new innovative technology best ability personal frustration strife comes game Yes Cruz azul horrid mistakes cost goals yes lame half absolutely single time hope got shot America found way pick immediately fire con huevos invite team league season predicament assure result wodisappointing know final nail coffin came decision matter circumstance perception ,en,en,2024,LigaMX

When the America player complained even the ref said no then as soon as Tigres had that ball 1v1 vs the goalie he decides to stop the play and takes like 5 seconds to check just to say what we all knew already.

There are at least six or eight teams without investment, that don't even care about the quality of the squad because they know that without relegation and by winning three games by the end of the season they can reach repechaje. In fact, I'll name them: Querétaro, Mazatlán, Juárez, Tijuana, San Luis and Necaxa. These teams dont provide anything to the league and their games from week 1 to week 12 are borderline unwatchable. Each of them have different issues but the thing is none of them at their current have done anything to deserve a spot in Liga MX since the removal of relegation.

If there was relegation and promotion it would force these teams to improve and the league overall. But now it has become an investment and money laundering paradise for a select group of people, because that way you don't allow new projects to get in. 

And I don't know what you're watching but the quality is terrible. Just because they disguise it with penalty shootouts in the repechaje doesn't mean there's quality football.

Returning to those six teams, one area that severely suffer is the development of youngsters. These teams don't even need an academy. That's why they named the 2nd division as a development league, but when it's full of corruption and players aren't fighting for anything it's irrelevant, and you see it in how little to no talent is brought to the first division from here despite it being full of young Mexican players. Teams like San Luis only gave like 10 minutes to academy players in the entire tournament. I don't even know if Mazatlán has an academy. Tijuana just buys foreigner players or from other teams to resell. This league is stuck in mediocrity.

Funny thing about this is that instead of punishing these teams like a normal league with a relegation, they ""punish"" them with a monetary sanction. So these teams that don't want to spend in the quality of their squads, refuse to invest in their academies and dont feel the need to do it, will have even more reasons to keep refusing to do it. It's an absolute mess.

Thought the linkup with Jimenez + Gimenez + Piojo was nice, wonder if Aguirre is going to stick with the 442 against tougher opposition. It seems to do well enough given Mexico's strengths, but I wish there were more dangerous crosses as Gimenez/Jimenez are definitely lethal in the air and are able to work off of each other. The only downside I really saw is that a midfield of Romo/Edson doesn't offer much offensively and they were playing a really high line, although Panama was just sitting back. 

This tournament also really showed Aguirre's experience with getting players to punch above their weight, everyone did their part in his system, and it was looking like a well-refined machine. I think Mexico lacked this before, as there would be lapses and they'd concede over an individual mistake and not recover mentally, waiting for someone to step up. Aguirre's used to scrapping 1-0 or 2-1 wins by any means necessary, and his teams always had that hunger collectively to chase a win to the last minute (At least recently in Spain). 2nd half while yes they only got a penalty last minute, Panama didn't do anything offensively as Mexico was completely in control.",gg Jimenez hard carrying 👑 Thought linkup Jimenez + Gimenez + Piojo nice wonder Aguirre going stick 442 tougher opposition given Mexicos strengths wish dangerous crosses Gimenez/Jimenez definitely lethal air able work downside saw midfield Romo/Edson nt offer offensively playing high line Panama sitting tournament showed Aguirres experience getting players punch weight system looking like -refined machine think Mexico lacked lapses d concede individual mistake recover mentally waiting step Aguirres scrapping 1-0 2-1 wins means necessary teams hunger collectively chase win minute recently Spain 2nd half yes got penalty minute Panama nt offensively Mexico completely control,en,en,2025,LigaMX

Now that's the rule, but the interpretation sucks. Why have referees if they're gonna make robot interpretations.

The Monterrey player is obviously looking to pass the ball to his teammate he isn't just sending the ball upfront for no reason at all, so his intention is obviously, for anyone that isn't brain dead, to find his teammate. So therefore he implicitly interferes on the play even if the ball didn't manage to reach him, or if he wasn't blocking the GK, he was obviously the intended receptor of that ball.

Frequently weaker teams have a time of intensity rush (usually at the start of the game) to overwhelm the strong team in order to get a goal early (if they are lucky), and defend the advantage/tie the rest of the game. Similar to a Blitzkrieg tactic. The problem is that usually after that time they deflate after the extremely taxing intensity period. We saw this at this game. Monterrey was garbo this game, but by sheer competency and basic game sense, they navigated with no effort to a goleada.

Andrada was key to defend those first 30 minutes. I don't see him as bad as other people say he is.

Stefan Medina, Gallardo and Romo, after being out for long, are clearly NOT READY for professional football. Stefan was directly responsible for the goal against.

Cortizo should stop flopping every time he carries the ball.

I like how Brandon Vázquez goes to pressure the ball on the opponent's back side. He's very effective at that.

Overall, not a bad game. I hate how Rayados always plays at half gas tho. So unbecoming for us.",Comunicaciones dominated 30 min Comunicaciones Monterrey rest game Frequently weaker teams time intensity rush usually start game overwhelm strong team order goal early lucky defend advantage/tie rest game Similar Blitzkrieg tactic problem usually time deflate extremely taxing intensity period saw game Monterrey garbo game sheer competency basic game sense navigated effort goleada Andrada key defend 30 minutes nt bad people Stefan Medina Gallardo Romo long clearly READY professional football Stefan directly responsible goal Cortizo stop flopping time carries ball like Brandon Vázquez goes pressure ball opponents s effective Overall bad game hate Rayados plays half gas tho unbecoming ,en,en,2024,LigaMX

jumps at  
kicks or attempts to kick  
pushes  
strikes or attempts to strike (including head-butt)

Reckless is when a player acts with disregard to the danger to, or consequences for, an opponent and must be cautioned  
Using excessive force is when a player exceeds the necessary use of force and endangers the safety of an opponent and must be sent off

Both would be called for a foul in the middle of the pitch without hesitation, so should be called up for a penalty without hesitation as well. Referees need to be stronger and not worry about negative implications of calling a penalty if they believe it is one. I feel the referees are too reliant on VAR to make the call for them and their job is to just let the game flow as much as possible, which we see a lot with offside calls that are not even close to the player being onside still. But it would also be advantageous to supporters to be able to hear the thought processes that the officials are going through to make their decisions as in other sports like league, it will help those immensely that seem to have no idea about the majority of the rules",clear obvious errors easily penalties VAR suggested ref reconsider decisions called foul middle pitch hesitation called penalty hesitation Referees need stronger worry negative implications calling penalty believe feel referees reliant VAR job let game flow possible lot offside calls close player onside advantageous supporters able hear thought processes officials going decisions sports like league help immensely idea majority rules,en,en,2021,ALeague

1) the clip above - Upper arm still counts as the arm.  Rough rule of thumb is the 'point' of the shoulder is fine, but below that is arm.  Kinda where the seam of a t-shirt is.  The ball didn't even travel high enough for the shoulder - the only possibility is the chest.  IMO, the VAR is inconclusive - so to overrule the penalty is just ridiculous.  Had the ref not awarded a penalty, I'd be okay with no VAR penalty - again, only because it's not 100% conclusive.  I think there's some doubt as to whether it hit the chest - but sometimes the ref has a better view in real time.  And I do think it hit the arm

2) 2-handed push in Kerr's back.  This is just inexplicable.  If the ref missed it, that's exactly WHY we have VAR.  No explanation there

3) The other handball shout - the arm was quite some distance out from the body, those have been given pretty consistently as fouls for a long time.  Clear foul for me - it looked like she moved the arm further out just before the shot too.  

4) Our RC.  Again, disgraceful.  The ball was so far in front of the attacker that there was almost zero change of her getting to it before the keeper, so there's no DOGSO.

it shows they are at the same shitty VAR stage we were in year 1 after VAR, where they use it to find the correct decision no matter how long, rather than overruling obvious errors (often getting it wrong in the process)

As mentioned elsewhere, if you need to see the replay 15 times it is by definition not an obvious error, not matter what the initial call was.

Having said that, as I stated elsewhere, it's not like we would have scored anyway with the spot quality on show that day.

If you're familiar with the psychological concept of priming, I firmly believe this is going to prejudice the referee's decision towards a foul.

I also noticed that Shaun never viewed the footage at full speed. From the VAR Protocol:

*The referee can request different cameras angles/replay speeds but, in
general, slow motion replays should only be used for facts e.g. position of
offence/player, point of contact for physical offences and handball, ball out of
play (including goal/no goal); normal speed should be used for the ‘intensity’
of an offence or to decide if a handball was ‘deliberate’*  
  
It's a pity FIFA don't allow these conversations to be live.  

Take the potentially offside goal in the PG-CCM match.  We still have absolutely no idea why that goal was allowed.  Was the offside line considered too close?  Was the attacker considered to be not interfering?  Why?  

It's frustrating.", think conversation good like hearing – nt like shows point contact arm ref running making thing sees familiar psychological concept priming firmly believe going prejudice referees decision foul noticed Shaun viewed footage speed VAR Protocol *referee request different cameras angles/replay speeds general slow motion replays facts eg position offence/player point contact physical offences handball ball play including goal/goal normal speed ‘intensity’ offence decide handball ‘deliberate’* pity FIFA nt allow conversations live potentially offside goal PG-CCM match absolutely idea goal allowed offside line considered close? attacker considered interfering? ? frustrating,en,en,2021,ALeague

It isn’t about refs not being able to rescind a yellow, they can, it’s that the referee was given a factual offside decision that nulled the need for him to review the footage, and as he didn’t do that he has no basis to confirm that it was not in fact a dive. Remember, VAR doesn’t tell the referee it’s a penalty, it tells the referee to go have a look. If the referee doesn’t need to look due to offside, they don’t have the capacity to check the foul/not foul and rescind a yellow.

But in hindsight, I do recall Volkan having similar moments back in his day and what he always did was to actually confirm with ref, especially in such relaxed situations. Not actually letting the ball go and then grabbing it back up, but more nuanced cases like some hard deflections, or random bounced balls from defenders coming back to him that were not actual passes etc. He always glanced at the ref and signaled with his hands whether he could actually pick the ball up.",frank idea ball control thinking exact specifics rule nt surprised registered mind let ball shit goalie knowing rule hindsight recall Volkan having similar moments day actually confirm ref especially relaxed situations actually letting ball grabbing nuanced cases like hard deflections random bounced balls defenders coming actual passes etc glanced ref signaled hands actually pick ball ,en,en,2023,superlig

You tried to explain your penalties with dribbling and I told you that with messi + mbappe + neymar who are in top 5 dribbler in the world, had 7 penalties last year, whereas you had 17. 

Dribbling doesn't justify it at all. 

In turkey the ball stays in the field for 50-52 min and in france, it is probably 58-60 mins. Not justifying 2.5x penalties either. 

FB/GS/BJK did 15 fouls per game last year, big3 are not really a teams with low fouls either. They got probably 5-6 penalties against, at most.

What is absolutely irritating is the very fact that the ref did not even try to look at VAR when the decision is that close, and is that important. We've seen very clear and obvious calls get second looks for sometimes not so decisive moments. What us Galatasaray fans can't comprehend is the fact that these refs completely ignored the system and option to look at what us fans, and football lovers regardless of our team preferences, also saw on TV. İster Beşiktaşlı ol, ister Fenerli, ister Trabzon Goztepe Giresunspor. Farketmez. Us fans, our clubs and players, have to trust these referees and the federation to some degree. & regardless of how annoyed we get in the moment, as humans we accept their mistakes time to time.


But to not even look at the fucking VAR for a massively decisive call is disrespectful and it makes not only all their fans hate you for it, it makes the other fans lose even further trust in you. Some of our rivals might be happy this happened today, fine, but when time comes and they are in a similar situation, they're going to have even LESS confidence in the TFF and referees because they saw the mistakes they can and have made in the past.

In my understanding of football, this is no pen. Liva isn't even looking at his legs, and he's looking to fall anyway. A gray position closer to no pen. Ref not giving it at first for me is a good take. After going to VAR though, ref has to give it. Contact is clear. No ref that won't give it after watching slow-mo, that's the reality of VAR. Both of these calls, giving the pen with VAR and not giving it on the pitch are understandable decisions.

The issue here is on VAR imo, there is a communications issue. VAR just calls the ref for a review after telling him there is contact. The correct question is to ask ""have you seen the contact"" first. Only if the ref says ""no"" then a review is merited. If the ref says ""yes, I didn't think the contact is a pen"" then VAR cannot say ""but I think it is"". VAR cannot comment on positions. Only reasonable way for this turn of events is the ref thinking contact is a pen but the ball is out, going to review to check if it was in. No way to miss the contact there, unless ref was watching the stands instead of the 1v1 lol.",late charges punished lets start agreeing rule says fouls OK position missed lol understanding football pen Liva nt looking legs s looking fall gray position closer pen Ref giving good going VAR ref Contact clear ref wont watching slow-mo s reality VAR calls giving pen VAR giving pitch understandable decisions issue VAR imo communications issue VAR calls ref review telling contact correct question ask seen contact ref says review merited ref says yes nt think contact pen VAR think VAR comment positions reasonable way turn events ref thinking contact pen ball going review check way miss contact ref watching stands instead 1v1 lol,tr,en,2024,superlig

Yarım saatte 3 atıp, 50. dakikada da penaltı alınca Uğurcan'ın gelmesine ""Lan taşak mı geçiyor bizimle"" demelerini doğal karşılarım. Niyet o olmasa bile, random Sivaslı oyuncuların ve taraftarların, Uğurcan'ın iki saat önce çocuğunun doğduğunu ve gol atıp ona hediye etmek istediğini bilmeleri mümkün değil, ki Trabzonlu arkadaşlar yorumlarda açıklamasa ne ben biliyordum, ne de buradaki diğerleri biliyordu. 

Context yokken, 3-0 laylaylom gidiyor, kalecinin penaltıcılıkla alakası yokken oraya gelmesi, forvetlerin kaleciyi çalımlayıp, kale çizgisinde durdurup, eğilip kafayla iteklemesi gibi bir şey. Dediğim gibi, Uğurcan'ın contextini bilmezkenki durumdan bahsediyorum. Güzel bir jest düşüncesiydi bence, ama şartlar talihsizdi.

Son dakikalarda kafaya çıkmayı doğru bir benzetme olarak görmüyorum. Son dakika kornerine çıkmak çaresizlikten, ihtimali arttırmak için yapılan bir risk. 3-0 öndeyken gönder kalecini, başka hiçbir oyuncunu da ceza sahasına sokma, o zaman da derler ""Taşak mı geçiyorsun bizle"" diye.

Ha maç 0-0'dır mesela, veya 1-0 geridesindir, o zaman kalecin kullanmaya kalkarsa kimse kendisiyle dalga geçildiğini düşünmez, ""Ne kadar güveniyorlar kalecilerine"" derler.

But regarding the referee, he literally gave the match from one side the other side. This would be one of the best match of the year, two top tier teams of our league is in their top forms playing against each other. Why would you put your name in front of the match and try to act like Cuneyt Cakir. This is not your show where you have to act like boss all the game.

Kim’s first yellow was his FIRST foul in the match, and second yellow is his second. Remember Diagne’s position for Galatasaray, he literally destroyed every defender on his way, how the hell if that’s not a foul today’s position was a foul? In premier league this would be no way a foul, and they would never allow such referee to have matches after this if it happened there. 

Nwakeme literally showed card gesture with his hands, he saw it, no card. He then kept on protesting 1 minute more, no card. Gustavo came with his hands behind to protest, immediate card, so Gustavo was locked in to play passively. 

Some player kicked the bilboards after Trabzon’s second goal, no card again. 

I think the position of Szalai was a good call, it was penalty, but if it was happening during a corner kick I doubt they would give this a penalty also. 

Trabzon had potential to win this game, this could be 4-3 or 2-2 or whatsoever. But we would watch a decent game, the ref literally butchered it. Already foreign reporters are protesting it from Kim’s country.

Salazar'ın Üç F'si (Portekizce: três F de Salazar), Portekiz'in 1932'den 1968'e kadar başbakanlığını yapan António de Oliveira Salazar'ın de facto totaliter rejiminin dayanağı kabul edilen ifadedir. Üç F ifadesi futbol, fado ve Fátima'yı temsil eder. İfade sıklıkla yanlış olarak Salazar yerine İspanyol diktatör Francisco Franco'nun rejimine atfedilerek Fátima yerine fiesta ifadesini temsilen kullanılır. Üç F ifadesi, Estado Novo rejimini yıkan Karanfil Devriminin ardından Salazar'ın meşruiyetinin ana dayanağı olarak yaygınlaşmıştır.

Üç F, Salazar'ın meşruiyetinin halkın spor, eğlence ve din ile uyuşturulmasıyla sağlandığını ifade eder. Futbolun Portekiz'de önemli yer tutması ve bir Portekiz halk müziği olan fado spor ve eğlence ile ilişkilendirilirken Katoliklerin hac noktalarından Fátima, din ile ilişkilendirilmektedir. Bu ifade, ideolojik olarak ise bazen milliyetçilik, muhafazakârlık ve dindarlık ilkeleriyle ilişkilendirilmektedir.

The previous one was the ""Süper Final"" period. We received a well organized theatre where the champion must not be changed from the original ending of the season. So they halved the points to get FB and GS closer, minimized the point difference through the games, and made the final game a FBvGS that ended with a boring draw and 2 red cards, so people would have content to talk about while being angry enough to be distracted with the controversial reds that they would not pay attention to the scripting. The scripting was understandable to an extent, GS deserved championship with a clear difference in the normal season, and there would understandably be a shitshow, if they lost it due to the halving of points at the end.

This season, we are watching the same, but extended to the full season.

Looks like we are missing another world cup, but i think as the coach knows the players more, we might get better. Subbing off Cengiz was the wrong move.

Edit: some more thoughts. I have never seen a left back kill so many attacks, it was actually impressive. Kerem kept showing him runs and Caner was like, nah i am just gonna kick it.

I would like to share a personal story and would appreciate it if people who are interested read it without considering any fandoms - I firmly believe the same issues apply to all teams, and by the end many of you can relate to why I am saddened by this. But as a Fenerbahçe fan this story is based on my perspective.

I’ve been living in the U.S. for over a decade now and obviously watch every Fenerbahçe game, no matter the time or my work. I’ve married a girl here who appreciates soccer and always admired my support.

She always tried to watch games with me. She genuinely was making an effort. But over the years it has become less and less because she says “it disturbs me how corrupt this is. They’re not playing soccer.”

Yesterday, she got up and put on her jersey to watch the game with me early in the morning. Before Kim’s first yellow she said “I’m surprised we haven’t seen the referee ruin the game yet.” 20 seconds later he got the first yellow. I said it’s questionable how eager he was to give it, but let’s think positive. I then went to pick up a food delivery - I was gone for just 2 minutes during which Kim got his red. She texted me “Kim got his second yellow.” When I came upstairs she said she was bothered and did not want to watch the game anymore. She left to do something in another room and I finished the game on my own.

She watches MLB, NBA, NFL games with me without any issues. Because she says they are fair. She constantly leaves Turkish soccer games because she says they are corrupt and disgust her. This has become, as my favorite hobby, something I can’t share with my wife (even though I feel she has made every effort to enjoy it with me).

This makes me so sad. I wonder how I can convince my future kids to watch this league with me. I wonder how I can justify to my friends that this league is worth following over others so we can discuss it. Even further, I wonder if it is even healthy for me to be so invested.

As a Turk, this fandom is part of me and will never disappear. But objectively, the situation with Turkish soccer absolutely disgusts me. It has become an absolute joke, you cannot enjoy games without issues, it’s impossible to approach a referee without inherent distrust.

I believe that my situation is an example of what many others also face. And I wonder what will happen as this awareness and disgust grows. Why should younger kids in Turkey become interested in this? Why should fans go to games? Interest is clearly declining as we can see from attendance numbers.

This is a massive issue and the TFF statement reflects that we are nowhere near fixing it. This sport is run by people who are a joke. And we are losing any relevance we had. The national team performance makes this even clearer. It saddens me that in a country of 80 million people this is supposedly our national sport.

I wish there was something we could do, but I really don’t see it ever getting fixed.

This is what you expect from fan accounts, not officials. If you want to contest a call, do it - I've got no problem with that. But to constantly bring it up for hours on end really is a new low.

Now onto the actual position - the hardest thing to contest is a VAR offside. I can understand if the referee doesn't give a penalty in a position or something since that is all subjective, but an offside is objective, using technology such as calibrated cameras to help in making the decision. The PL has a whole section on their website talking about this, and how certain camera angles can be deceiving without VAR, such as this one for example. Although it is always possible for something to be slightly off, it is extremely unlikely with VAR. To continue off of this, I love how FB fans who are bringing this up fail to recognize the two potential penalty calls GS could've gotten through VAR but weren't looked at. They just need to recognize that GS played better today and deserved the win, it's as simple as that. 

To wrap this up though, in an ideal world the TFF and MHK would be transparent with their decisions which can shut down speculation and all these stupid arguments. That said, I sadly don't see that happening any time soon.",official accounts board members constantly crying single position 3 hours sad tbh expect fan accounts officials want contest - ve got problem constantly bring hours end new low actual position - hardest thing contest VAR offside understand referee nt penalty position subjective offside objective technology calibrated cameras help making decision PL section website talking certain camera angles deceiving VAR example possible slightly extremely unlikely VAR continue love FB fans bringing fail recognize potential penalty calls GS ve gotten VAR nt looked need recognize GS played better today deserved win simple wrap ideal world TFF MHK transparent decisions shut speculation stupid arguments said sadly nt happening time soon,tr,en,2021,superlig

Referee errors are a big part of sports debate, both in other football leagues and in other sports. In the Premier League, Serie A, and La Liga, some mistakes affect the winner of the match and even who will be relegated from the league. If you watch the matches in these leagues, you will see the same. The situation is not much different in other sports. Referee decisions were also very influential in Verstappen's F1 championship in 2021. In the NBA, it is constantly mentioned that the referees favor some players. It is always mentioned that some teams are protected in international and national basketball matches in Europe. Fans cry about it all the time. But the biggest difference between TSL and other leagues is the attitude of the clubs towards these mistakes. While in other leagues the clubs remain silent because the penalties are very harsh, here each club blames its every failure on the referee's decisions. In the Bundesliga, where Bayern has been champion for 10 years in a row, while no club says that Bayern has become the champion thanks to the referees, everyone is talking about the referees in our league, where different teams compete for the championship every year. The performance of the Turkish referees may be lower than the performance of the referees in the leagues I have mentioned, but the main reason why the referees are talked about so much is not their performance, but the football culture here.",realize referees problem TSL Referee errors big sports debate football leagues sports Premier League Serie La Liga mistakes affect winner match relegated league watch matches leagues situation different sports Referee decisions influential Verstappens F1 championship 2021 NBA constantly mentioned referees favor players mentioned teams protected international national basketball matches Europe Fans cry time biggest difference TSL leagues attitude clubs mistakes leagues clubs remain silent penalties harsh club blames failure referees decisions Bundesliga Bayern champion 10 years row club says Bayern champion thanks referees talking referees league different teams compete championship year performance Turkish referees lower performance referees leagues mentioned main reason referees talked performance football culture ,en,en,2023,superlig

But I think the main reaction to Onyekuru’s position stem from the fact that many people, including me, was expecting something like that to go down after Rize awarded a red card after Emre's unlucky position. Unlike the 3rd minute penalty awarded to us in the first game of the season, Onyekuru's penalty was also a very critical turning point and a huge decision. Plus, one difference is also that, in Kruse's position the defender makes the tackle from behind and both fall down as a result of the impact. In Henry's position you can see him stepping his foot on the ground first and then fall afterwards.

But I agree with your point nevertheless. These kind of positions show the deep down hypocrisies we all have. If it's against my team, why then it is clearly a penalty. But if it's against yours, clearly not. This vicious cycle needs to come to an end at some point.

Same referee (just 4 months ago), opposing goalie holds for 15 seconds, nothing happens. That's why people are calling him out I think. The rule is there, and according to the rulebook he's absolutely correct to make that call. But based on how he himself officiates, and how the beinsports referee post game analysis dude said this rule is almost never actually used in Turkey (last time it was called was in 2009), people feel like this was him just trying to give Gaziantep any chance to score. If he hadn't stopped the game and called that, he would have had to end the game when Okan kicked it away since it was at like minute 102 of a 96 minute game.

Edit: https://twitter.com/SuatKaraman38/status/1274856237008596994

This one is even better. This same game, GS is behind 1-0 against Gaziantep. Goalie catches the ball at :52. The video cuts away at :59 while still in goalies hands (7 seconds, already violating the rule). The video gets back at :11 to show the ball landing. That's 19 seconds after the goalie catches the ball. Let's be generous and say it took the ball 5 seconds to get to midfield, that means the held the ball for 14 seconds and the same ref in the same game did not stop the game due to this same rule that he seems to be so respectful towards.", referee 4 months ago opposing goalie holds 15 seconds happens s people calling think rule according rulebook s absolutely correct based officiates beinsports referee post game analysis dude said rule actually Turkey time called 2009 people feel like trying Gaziantep chance score nt stopped game called end game Okan kicked away like minute 102 96 minute game Edit better game GS 1-0 Gaziantep Goalie catches ball 52 video cuts away 59 goalies hands 7 seconds violating rule video gets 11 ball landing s 19 seconds goalie catches ball Lets generous took ball 5 seconds midfield means held ball 14 seconds ref game stop game rule respectful ,en,en,2020,superlig
8889,hdfktf,fvm9jif,Referees and questionable calls [Week 28],Referees questionable calls Week 28,"I am going to agree with you guys here. I think the rules are enforced more vigilantly when the referees are willing to “see what they want to see”.

Don’t get me wrong, if a keeper holds the ball for 18 seconds than a referee should call it. Same with Altay’s saving the penalty: if a keeper’s foot is not on the line, it should be replied. HOWEVER, these rules should be applied to all teams indiscrimanetly. When referees consistently enforce rules that are disadvantaging only one team and be more lax in calling it for other teams, then it is only natural to seek an ulterior motive here. Believe me, as a Fenerbahce fan I have seen it all too well with the replayed penalty and other contested VAR decisions this season. I think the reason is all too clear for those who are not yet blinded by their fanaticism to see. I really don’t think in any other time or for any other team that call would be given.",going agree guys think rules enforced vigilantly referees willing “want ” wrong keeper holds ball 18 seconds referee Altaysaving penalty keeperfoot line replied rules applied teams indiscrimanetly referees consistently enforce rules disadvantaging team lax calling teams natural seek ulterior motive Believe Fenerbahce fan seen replayed penalty contested VAR decisions season think reason clear blinded fanaticism think time team given,en,en,2020,superlig

The precedent that this decision will lead to is that everybody who is disadvantaged by a referee will demand the same. We all know that this decision has only been made because GS as a club with fans and influential figures were all heavily pressuring TFF.
