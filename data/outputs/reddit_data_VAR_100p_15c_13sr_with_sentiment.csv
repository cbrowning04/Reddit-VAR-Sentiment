Regardless of what happens, the match officials consult and the final decision is made by the ref. This is all audible to the TV audience and they’re making it audible at the stadiums as well.

This video does nothing but make VAR look bad. I’m a lawyer and so all this standard of review stuff is familiar. VAR has a stated standard of review of “clear and obvious error.”  That means that VAR can only intervene if the onfield ref made a clear and obvious error. 

The penalty decision here did not rise to that level. It could have gone either way. Hence, not a clear and obvious error. 

This video and the conversation is centered on basically analyzing “what a penalty is.”  That’s not the controversy here. The controversy is why VAR intervened at all; it all seems arbitrary. Why does Anthony keep asking whether there was contact? Because *if there weren’t*, then Havertz dived and *that* would be a clear and obvious error. But there was contact so VAR is asking refs to review grey areas? That’s not clear and obvious. 

Either lower the standard or stick with them. This video confirms that clear and obvious error is *not* the standard, and getting drawn into the “whether that was a penalty” debate is to give these refs a pass that they don’t deserve.",think people drawn propaganda transparency missing point video VAR look bad lawyer standard review stuff familiar VAR stated standard review “clear obvious error” means VAR intervene onfield ref clear obvious error penalty decision rise level gone way clear obvious error video conversation centered basically analyzing “penalty ” controversy controversy VAR intervened arbitrary Anthony asking contact? ** Havertz dived ** clear obvious error contact VAR asking refs review grey areas? clear obvious lower standard stick video confirms clear obvious error ** standard getting drawn “penalty” debate refs pass deserve,en,en,2023,PremierLeague,"[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.33578306436538696}]",Neutral,0.33578306436538696,"[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.40432024002075195}]",Neutral,0.40432024002075195,Neutral

Having seen the replay I immediately thought it'd be overturned and would be absolutely furious if it was given against us.

Second penalty imo is a penalty.  The Wolves player gets none of the ball and his knee clips Wilson's knee.  It's a foul, I can see why the ref didn't give it as the angle he had doesn't show the contact however Wilson gets ahead of the Wolves player and gets caught.

However, fouls like that resulting in penalties feels so ridiculously harsh.  There was no danger and he was going away from goal.  Giving the attacking side a goal scoring opportunity for free is way too big a ""reward"" for things like that.  I wouldn't be against a change in the rules where penalties are only given if a goalscoring opportunity is denied, otherwise it's an indirect free kick.  Yes it would add a bit more subjectivity into it but it would also stop attacking players going for balls like this (and also the Cairney one) when they know that if they get a touch on the ball and get slightly clipped then odds are it's a goal.  Tiny inconsequential fouls in the penalty area just shouldn't be a 75/80% chance at a goal.

Vinicius should have been sent off, for the third time this season, for violent conduct.  If he never plays for us again it'd be a day too soon.

As for the second yellow on Ream, I expected it but given the Man Utd penalty and lack of second yellow for Young there's at least some consistency in incorrect decisions this weekend.  The ref seemed to be on the lenient side card wise, as there were a few yellows that I expected to be given that weren't.

I watch and play rugby and the TMO has a delayed feed aswell as a live one, they can refer a ref back or correct any decisions quite sharpish and if VAR had that then this would have been resolved before. It is clear and obvious when reviewed, the change I would make is ""clear and obvious"" shouldn't apply to penalties or foul decisions and it should be ""has there been foul play"" for this situation. Therefore the ref has to look and it's not up to the VAR official.
Here's a simple format for decisions:

Offside=has there been a clear and obvious mistake?

Handballs=is there a clear and obvious handball contact?

Fouls=has there been foul play, ref reviews in person

There was no chance of him being offside as the ball swung into Stones because you can't be offside from a corner kick. 

What was the position and his actions at and after the header? That is the only point at which he can possibly commit an offside offence. By then he had separated from Sa and wasn't obstructing his view, and the rules are very clear that simply being in an offside position alone without interfering is not an offence. 

I genuinely think this is a fantastic decision from the referee, especially as they know the expectation is that most decisions are overturned when they check the monitor (rightly or wrongly). We give them stick when they fuck up and he deserves credit here.

And lets clarify that Silva standing his ground, or 'backing into' Sa isn't a foul before some people argue that line. You can only be penalised for obstruction if you move into the way of a player as they would try to play the ball, but Silva had already picked up that position before corner.

He next says ""he's kicked the player"". That's where VAR should intervene and suggest to Taylor that 'actually from the various views around the field he doesn't appear to kick the player as he pulls out of kicking entirely'.

At that point Taylor should be asked to view the monitor and make a judgement based on what actually happened to see if his view on the pitch was distorted, and to give him clarity on what actually happened.

It wasn't the refs fault or VAR's that they gave a stupid handball, they were simply following the rules they are told to. 
 Some refs are just crap, but thats everywhere. In these international competitions they pick who they consider are the best ref's, so you would expect less mistakes and better officiating. But the smoothness of this Euros is simply down to the ref's being told to let some hard tackles go and their implementation of VAR seems superb.

Peter Walton and other high profile ex-refs back them up more often than not, and when they disagree they try to make us understand the referee's position. Yes, being a ref is hard. No, that does not mean we have to tolerate moronic logic and decisions.  


Half the shit refs have to put up with from players could be sorted if they were simply mic'ed up - but they won't do that because:  
1 They enjoy the sycophantic nature of thinking their friends with players like Harry Kane because they can call him ""Harry"".  
2 That would help keep them accountable, and increase the level of professionalism expected of them.  


These two things would ruin two of the main reasons these people are where they are - these are the things that motivate them.  


I've been saying it all season, and I've only heard Graeme Souness (ugh) suggest anything similar: Sack them all. Literally all premier league referees. They will be \*fine\*. Move everyone up, promote from below and create a new set of motivating factors. And mic referees the f up. Aim for the level of professionalism expected of rugby refs and players.  


It will be a difficult transition for the divas in the premier league, but it wont take many high profile bans of players swearing at refs and therefore live on television before they change their behaviour. Surrounding the referee ends immediately. Openly lying to the referee about what happens means you get exposed as a cheat because people can actually hear a diver say ""He cleaned me out!"" when nobody touched them, or hear a player say ""I got the ball!"" when they definitely didn't.

More from the article:

 who played the pass to Saka, and then looked to use one of the other   
cameras, which are all time-synced, to apply the offside lines.

I think the reason this system works well is because it's the on-field officials that are making the call and they go to video replay right away. They also then come into the center of the field and announce to the stadium and broadcast what the correct call is and why they are sticking with it or overturning it.

Are they right 100% of the time? No and they never will be, we will always have some sort of human error and that's OK.

The camera is 60fps. So at the strict minimum you have an uncertainty of measurement of :
1/2 * 1/60 * 30/3.6 = 0.069m = 7cm

that’s assuming we can determine the precise frame closest to the shot, measure the lines exactly and consistently. This also consider the defenders is still. If the defenders move with the attackers the speed differential would decrease.

I got curious so I looked and Broadcast cameras are 50fps (https://www.premierleague.com/news/1488423). They mention they use the broadcast cameras to find out the moment the pass is made, and to synchronize the cameras. Assuming all cameras have exactly they same shutter speed (so once they are synchronized the dont phase out of sync) we got the uncertainty :
U = Usync + Upass 
= 2* Uone_frame
= 1/50 * 30/3.6
= 0.166 = 17cm

And that’s being very generous and looking at only the shot position. Btw looking at pictures the line width seems to be around 5cm so the uncertainty on shot positioning is greater than three line widths.

Line position uncertainty is half the line width per line so 1 line width total. If we go with 5cm it gives us 22cm total uncertainty.

Especially since - even though PRO didn't admit it - the foul itself was suspect (ie likely not a foul) and that was probably not the bigger goof.

So PRO blew it, but how much advantage did Seattle get by taking the kick so far away from where the foul was called? You could argue some. But hardly the same as a FK near the penalty box or if they had moved it 20 yards in the opposite direction.

I'd be curious how egregious this was in terms of where the restart occured. Annecdotally, I see refs being picky about location when the foul was close to goal or if the kicking team tries to move it much closer to goal. This was neither.

So are we going to see PRO being *really* picky about restarts for a few weeks? 

Like I guess Seattle got away with one here, and I'll admit it, but it honestly feels more like the average officiating blunder that just happened to occur right before a goal vs the blunder caused the goal.

Even if you want to give a yellow because your view was bad, sure, whatever. A straight red for something that wasn't even a clear goal scoring chance? Then doubling down? I usually hate North/South American refs for letting things that are clear yellows/reds slide, but he gives a red for this? Not only is this not consistent with the rules of the game, it's not consistent with the severity of punishment the ref gave throughout the game. No yellows for intentionally throwing players to the ground to stop quick build-ups? It's a joke to give a red for this. Assuming Mulraney even fouled someone at all and it's clear that he didn't.

This game probably won't matter in the end, but this is just such a disgusting decision it makes it really hard to take MLS seriously.

As for obstructing the keeper. You'll repeatedly hear about the referee's discretion or opinion on this one. Bou was directly in the path of the ball, even if he's not very tall. If he would have been 4 yards further toward the back post the goal would have likely stood. But directly in the path of the ball, that close to both the last play and goal, it is not unreasonable for this to be called offside.

Basically, for an attacking player, it's good advice to move out of an offside position before the ball is played.

Nichtsdestotrotz sollten wir zum Punkt kommen, das unsere Schiedsrichter auf der einen Seite einfach besser werden und dafür auf der anderen Seite dann auch weniger Kritik abbekommen.

Irren ist Menschlich und die Schiris sind auch Menschen, trotzdem hat man das Gefühl seit dem VAR gibt's mehr Diskussionen um Fehlentscheidungen als vorher, besonders bei klar offensichtlichen Situationen oder fast gleichen Situationen die aber am gleichen Wochenende zum Unterschiedlichen Bewertungen von Schiedsrichtern führen.

Tatsächlich würde ich die ""Challenge"" aber ergänzend zum VAR einbauen, außer wir kommen wieder dahin das die Schiedsrichter ein wirklich gutes Niveau erreichen.

Ich würde sogar soweit gehen und sagen: Reform des VAR's das er nur noch für Grobe Unsportlichkeiten und Abseits da ist, aber nicht mehr für Überprüfungen von Toren oder sonstigem, da kann ein Trainer dann eben immer noch die Challenge ziehen. Besonders deswegen weil Unsportlichkeiten oft mal durch verschiedene ""Tatorte"" auf dem Platz übersehen werden und das Abseits ja ggf. schon ab nächster Saison wie auch in der CL, Halb-automatisch gemacht werden soll.

Danach musste ich wegen einer Erkrankung leider aufhören Spiele zu leiten. 

Der DFB weigert sich eine Kardinalfrage zu beantworten: Warum haben wir in Deutschland keine Profischiedsrichter. Es mag irgendwie romantisch sein, dass Versicherungskaufleute, ein Lehrer oder diverse Mediziner es bis zur WM geschafft haben. Schiedsrichter dieser Klassen sind Hochleistungssportler und ich habe Schiedsrichterkollegen erlebt, die mit dem Jahresurlaub durch die Saison geplant haben. Hier beißt sich der Hund in den Schwanz. 

Es muss eine gewisse Öffnung geben, die DFB Schiedsrichter GmbH benimmt sich immer wieder als wäre sie der Schiedsrichtersportkreis Fichtelgebirge. Zu einer Sache können die Kollegen, die heute an der Front sind aber nichts, die Fußballregelhüter haben den Sport weitgehend kaputtreguliert. Als ich damals meine Prüfung ablegte kam mein Regelbuch mit zwei Seiten zum Handspiel aus. Dort wurde erklärt was nun strafbar ist und was eben nicht. Heute ist die Handspielregel schwerer als biologische Physik. 

Ich halte die Idee des Videoschiedsrichters an sich für falsch. Wenn ich zwei oder drei Leute mehrere Autostunden von einem Spielort platziere, haben sie Bildschirme, das ist aseptisch. Das macht es künstlich und am Ende weiß ich, dass die Kniescheibe im Abseits war und mit dieser kann ein Tor erzielt werden. Der Schiedsrichter und sein Gespann ist am Geschehen, nimmt ein Spiel war und kann daher wesentlich besser urteilen. 

Mein Lieblingsbeispiel: Die persönliche Strafe nach einem Foulspiel. Nach der 12 Wiederholung sieht fast jeder Körperkontakt, im Regelbuch heißt es noch immer, dass dieser Körperkontakt zum Spiel gehört, fast zum offenen Knochenbruch geführt hat. Im realen Spieltempo ist der Zweikampf, den ich im Spiel A mit einem Freistoß ahnden kann auch deswegen richtig, weil er in die Dynamik des Spiels passt. Beim Spiel B muss ich hier vielleicht zwingend noch eine persönliche Strafe aussprechen, weil das Spiel eher nickelig ist und ich weniger Leine lassen kann. Diese Freiheit wird dem Schiedsrichter genommen, was ich wahnsinnig bedauerlich finde.

Mein letzter Gedanke ist ein Quervergleich: Im Profiboxen beschloss einer der fünf großen Verbände, dass nach Runde vier und Runde acht die Punktstände bekannt gegeben werden, was zu mehr Transparenz führen sollte. In Wahrheit hat es den Sport geschadet, weil die Luft raus war. Ich wusste zur achten Runde, dass der Kampf nicht mehr unentschieden ausgehen kann oder unterlegene Boxer noch aufholt und mit ein bisschen Erfahrung weiß man dann auch wer nun in Führung liegt.

2459,3110,lto16i,gp5zli6,Abolish VAR! Compilation of wrong decisions made despite or because of VAR (German commentary),Abolish VAR! Compilation wrong decisions despite VAR German commentary,"For 1) I am pretty sure that all the statistics point to less wrong decisions. Yeah it's even more infuriating when the decision is wrong and not corrected by the VAR, but it usually means that the decision would have been wrong either way. It is *very* rare that the ref changes the call from right to wrong after VAR involvement. Although that seems to be untrue, it simply is selection bias - it sticks to your memory a lot more.

2) was a BS argument from the beginning, everybody knows that football is a game of passion and there *will* be discussions, no matter what.

3) I can neither confirm nor deny, but in my book it is basically irrelevant. I don't have a problem with 20-30 seconds between a situation and the check to complete.. I don't feel it interrupts the flow a lot, but YMMV.

The (perceived and actual) randomness of On-Field Reviews (OFRs) is due to the refs calls. No one can force a ref to an OFR, he or she decides all by themselves. It is inherently random since the perception of the ref is the deciding factor. If the VAR asks the ref ""have you noticed a contact of the left feet?"" and the ref says ""yeah, that was not enough"", there is no OFR, if he says ""what? No!"" that's an error in perception and the ref would be an idiot and at fault not to take the opportunity for an OFR. But that is probably a lot less dependent on the VAR than on the on-field ref.. (see below)

I agree that IFAB fucked up with the hand rule. They simply cannot find a way to make it ""easy"" to decide and therefore avoid different calls in very similar situations.. But it is quite the hard task to make a perfect rule. If it was completely and categorically forbidden to touch the ball with the whole arm, that would lead to silly situations nobody wants penalties for and still leaves the question ""arm or shoulder/back/chest?"" for debate...

My main point is the transparency. How was the decision really made? That is somewhat helped by releasing the communications between ref and VAR, but I get that such a step could potentially undermine the refs and some of them don't feel too comfortable with this idea.

In the end, it is a game played by humans with humans deciding and humans err. I don't see why we would be better off without the VAR.",1 pretty sure statistics point wrong decisions Yeah infuriating decision wrong corrected VAR usually means decision wrong way ** rare ref changes right wrong VAR involvement untrue simply selection bias - sticks memory lot 2 BS argument beginning everybody knows football game passion ** discussions matter 3 confirm deny book basically irrelevant nt problem 20-30 seconds situation check complete nt feel interrupts flow lot YMMV perceived actual randomness -Field Reviews OFRs refs calls force ref OFR decides inherently random perception ref deciding factor VAR asks ref noticed contact left feet? ref says yeah OFR says ? ! s error perception ref idiot fault opportunity OFR probably lot dependent VAR -field ref agree IFAB fucked hand rule simply find way easy decide avoid different calls similar situations hard task perfect rule completely categorically forbidden touch ball arm lead silly situations wants penalties leaves question arm shoulder//chest? debate main point transparency decision ? somewhat helped releasing communications ref VAR step potentially undermine refs nt feel comfortable idea end game played humans humans deciding humans err nt better VAR,en,en,2021,Bundesliga,"[{'label': 'Very Negative', 'score': 0.5847975015640259}]",Very Negative,0.5847975015640259,"[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.3822946846485138}]",Neutral,0.3822946846485138,Negative

Noone cares about a Player beeing offside by a single blade of grass but that seems to be the only thing that VAR does at the moment. I argued from day one, make it a challange system. Every coach can challange anything. The ref looks At replays and does the right call, no ""not severe dnought to overturne call on the pitch"" thing, no really 100% the right call. If the coach challanges correctly he gets his challange back, if he is wrong he loses a Chance to substitute. If he loses a second challange he cant challange anymore after that. That way we integrate VAR with the 5 possible substitutions and get rid od discussions like this. If the coach challanges the penelty is overturned and if he doesnt its the teams own fault",nt like Hoppenheim like fair equal rules Stuff like allowed happen Refs mistakes ganz blame ref giving penalty kinda like handball sole point VAR rid avoidable mistakes cares Player beeing offside single blade grass thing VAR moment argued day challange system coach challange ref looks replays right severe dnought overturne pitch thing 100% right coach challanges correctly gets challange wrong loses Chance substitute loses second challange nt challange anymore way integrate VAR 5 possible substitutions rid od discussions like coach challanges penelty overturned nt teams fault,en,en,2021,Bundesliga,"[{'label': 'Very Negative', 'score': 0.4896763861179352}]",Very Negative,0.4896763861179352,"[{'label': 'Very Negative', 'score': 0.4569709897041321}]",Very Negative,0.4569709897041321,Very Negative

My translation:
There is not enough room in this article to list all the oddities of the lawsuit [against Dortmund fans who had shouted ""Hopp, you son of a bitch"" during the 2017/18 season]. The efforts taken by the investigators before suing the Dortmund fans were bizarre; a case officer spent a total of six weeks analysing video footage. The court refused to question Hopp as a witness; there wasn't even Hopp's official address in the files, so - in a hilariously smug gesture - the defending lawyers send their summons to Hopp's golf club.

But whats the realistic position here? I have to deal a lot with the 3 lowest leagues in my region. It basically happens every year, or at least 2 years, that among the plus minus 50 clubs in the district is one where suddenly a local entrepreneur (like car dealer, construction company, or so) enters the scene and wants to push his club up. They pour money in the clubs (sometimes even hire players into their company), get new players and often this indeed results that the team will get up 1-3 leagues. Unlike Hopp, they have not the funds and not the patience to get them higher. Indeed, such investors get quickly disappointed and often enough a team rises and falls apart in 4 years.

So you don't think that the need to quickly screen all angles, cutting the footage and having the abilit to decide which scenes you show to the deciding Referees is of upmost importance? Your dangerous mindset is exactly the reason why VAR currently is the shitshow it is.

Quickly screening all visual information and cutting it so that a ref can quickly gather information from your clips is NOT ""just operating a software"". Don't forget about the integrity needed for that job either. If I'm just gaining minimum wage then what stops me to take bribes and show the referee biased material? Nothing. Many potential foul checks look like a dive on 4 different angles and only one shows that true and sufficient contact has been made.

IF you want to call out one decision to be wrong, then it's actually the second goal because Sommer has NO chance of saving that shot. Idk who Michael Da Silva is, but the first call is offside. There is no incorrect call there. Both decisions are fine imo and also according to the rules.

(You couldn't get away with it as much in the prem cause everyone and their mother would be arguing letter of the law for every little incident imo) That being said, it clearly states that an incident in which a foul may have been committed inside the box should be checked for VAR and from that 
""The VAR can only give their opinion. The match referee has three options when they hear what their colleague has to say:

Leave their decision unchanged.
Accept the VAR's suggestion regarding a decision.
Watch the incident again themselves via a TV screen inside the stadium.""

Now, the incident in question wasn't even checked on VAR, which for me, is the key problem. If you're going to use VAR, you should be consistent. 

Now on to the question of if it's a pen or not. 

The handball rules used in the Bundesliga are actually nicely available on their website and the rule about natural positions that I believe you're referencing isn't mentioned. These are the rules that correlate with not giving a handball due to natural position. 

""if a player is falling and the ball touches their hand/arm when it is between their body and the ground to support the body (but not extended to make the body bigger)""
""the ball touches a player’s hand/arm which is close to their body and has not made their body unnaturally bigger""

HOWEVER --  the rule specifically states that these will not result in a foul UNLESS the situation fits one of these --

""a ball touches a player’s hand/arm which has made their body unnaturally bigger
the ball touches a player’s hand/arm when it is above their shoulder (unless the player has deliberately played the ball which then touches their hand/arm)""

Now, I'm not sure how they'd feel about the 2nd since he was on the ground, but rules as written his body was both in an unnatural position and it touched his arm when it was above his shoulder. Both of which supercede the rules that would protect against the pen. 

So based upon the rules the on the official bundesliga website, if the ref didn't see it, VAR should've still checked, and realistically, suggested a pen. From there, the ref could choose what to do.",Idk read rules bundesliga website rules little bit vaguer prem way makes clearer intention imo nt away prem cause mother arguing letter law little incident imo said clearly states incident foul committed inside box checked VAR VAR opinion match referee options hear colleague Leave decision unchanged Accept VARs suggestion decision Watch incident TV screen inside stadium incident question nt checked VAR key problem going use VAR consistent question pen handball rules Bundesliga actually nicely available website rule natural positions believe referencing nt mentioned rules correlate giving handball natural position player falling ball touches hand/arm body ground support body extended body bigger ball touches playerhand/arm close body body unnaturally bigger -- rule specifically states result foul situation fits -- ball touches playerhand/arm body unnaturally bigger ball touches playerhand/arm shoulder player deliberately played ball touches hand/arm m sure d feel 2nd ground rules written body unnatural position touched arm shoulder supercede rules protect pen based rules official bundesliga website ref nt VAR ve checked realistically suggested pen ref choose ,en,en,2020,Bundesliga,"[{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.33355188369750977}]",Negative,0.33355188369750977,"[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.561335563659668}]",Neutral,0.561335563659668,Neutral

Vs Rotherham our striker was sparked out following a clash of heads, where our striker started from a standing jump and the Rotherham defender ran and jumped into the challenge, free kick the Rotherham. I am not saying we should have had a pen, but given our player jumped in position, how is it a free kick.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Championship/comments/12s9ppf/blackburn_rovers_11_coventry_city_down_10_in_the/jgxkclv/

But a lot of the anger has been directed at their team for a very good reason. Until the last twenty minutes or so they were dominant. At half time they had 70% of the possession and Coventry hadn’t had a single shot, on or off target. Coventry were terrible for the vast majority of the game and Blackburn really, really should have put the game to bed. But they failed at that and it seems this isn’t the first time. Eventually they gave up trying and went the time wasting route instead (there were a ridiculous amount of ‘injuries’ in the last twenty minutes or so). And in doing so they let Coventry back into the game, to the point that they were pretty rampant towards the end.

So yeah, I think their anger at that overpowers their anger at the ref. And let’s not forget that the same referee failed to send a Blackburn player off for a second yellow after he did a flying kick on Panzo (he even wanted to give the free kick to Blackburn until the assistant corrected him), so if they want to complain about the ref they are going to have to deal with that first.",accepting match thread example lot anger directed team good reason minutes dominant half time 70% possession Coventry single shot target Coventry terrible vast majority game Blackburn game bed failed time Eventually gave trying went time wasting route instead ridiculous ‘injuries’ minutes let Coventry game point pretty rampant end yeah think anger overpowers anger ref letforget referee failed send Blackburn player second yellow flying kick Panzo wanted free kick Blackburn assistant corrected want complain ref going deal ,en,en,2023,Championship,"[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.4603116512298584}]",Neutral,0.4603116512298584,"[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.4032508432865143}]",Neutral,0.4032508432865143,Neutral

Red cards given for slow motion tackles/follow throughs that make the challenge look 10x worse than it is. Players basically dive to the floor the second they feel contact because they know the slowmo will make it look worse (if they don’t it isn’t given - see kilman for wolves last week).

Clear and obvious lost its meaning the second it came into play. Offside by an ear is bullshit, that is not an advantage and VAR giving that instead of a regular linesman sucks the “benefit of the doubt to the attacker” out of the game (the game which is about entertainment). 

Speaking of linesman, literally their only job now is to give throw-ins. What is the point in them currently?

Best things about being relegated to the championship is the fewer plastics and lack of VAR. I have hardly watched the prem/CL this season because VAR just ruins it for me. The rules of the game are far too subjective to narrow it down to a slow motion recording or freeze frame.

When it was introduced it was as if FIFA were trying to make it different enough to rugby to make it look original. All you need is one video ref watching the game with all the angles, telling the ref if he's missed something and showing it on the screen (can be those stupid pitchside monitors if they're really bothered about the crowd reaction influencing the decision). If you get to the point where you're drawing 3D lines on a still to see if someone's nose is offside, then it's not obvious at all.

En touchant sa jambe, le défenseur va involontairement contrarier ses appuis dans un moment où il aurait pu sinon frapper au but. Le plongeon à retardement est bien sûr ridicule, mais le fait de ne pas donner un penalty le serait autant.

Pour le constat initial, l'arbitre n'ayant pas suivi la VAR je ne vois pas comment on peut dire que cela prends trop d'importance. Au contraire, j'ai tendance à trouver que la VAR en général n'est pas assez suivie ou écoutée, et je suis bien content quand un but refusé pour hors-jeu est finalement accordé parce que l'attaquant est couvert de façon pas immédiatement évidente pour l'arbitre de ligne. Autant je suis prêt à ce que les actions soient arrêtées plus tôt quand le hors jeu est flagrant, autant les parties sont maintenant moins hachées par des hors-jeu imaginaires sifflés toutes les cinq minutes. Très souvent dans les cas litigieux l'attaque ne va pas au bout, et l'on ne revient pas sur le hors-jeu, ce qui fait des parties plus fluides.

Bref, je trouve que les cris sur la VAR sont improductifs, et je préfère discuter d'améliorations possibles de la VAR. A commencer par des suspensions après match, comme au rugby. Si Konaté prends un rouge a posteriori sur sa poussette sur Barcola, il ne joue pas au match retour. Si un plongeon manifeste sans contact est signalé après match, on peut imaginer des cartons jaunes. Avec la suspension pour trois cartons, les joueurs qui en abusent seraient vite calmés.

Bref, je suis plutôt pour les améliorations qui apaisent les débats (comme la goal line tech), même si comme pour toute décision il y a toujours des cas litigieux.

Le communiqué de Marseille est vraiment une belle blague, Eyraud est encore une fois à côté de la plaque.

Marseille était supérieur tactiquement, dans l'état d'esprit, et dans l'intensité, et méritait de gagner ce match c'est certain.

Le tifo était incroyable, les fumigènes étaient magnifiques, et l'ambiance était digne des 120 ans (aucune idée d'où vient l'animosité par contre, ou l'importance du match pour les marseillais depuis quelques années, mais bon).

Par contre, il y a des trucs inadmissibles qui se sont passés pendant ce match et avant. Le caillassage du bus, qui s'il avait été banalisé n'aurait probablement pas eu de double vitrage et les joueurs auraient été en danger. Les joueurs qui ne peuvent pas tiré un corner sans protection de la police avec un bouclier à cause de ""fans"" abrutis. Les ramasseurs de balle qui ne rendent pas le ballon et cherchent à gagner du temps (sérieux j'ai jamais vu ça depuis 15 ans que je regarde du foot, même dans une demi finale de ligue des champions ou dans un derby).

Tout ça participe à une ambiance malsaine. Accentué par la mauvaise agressivité des marseillais, notamment dans les dernières minutes, et sur un minot en plus. Et j'en veux pas vraiment à l'arbitre pour les erreurs d'arbitrage ça doit être compliqué d'officier dans ces conditions là. Eyraud par contre ne se grandit vraiment pas en ne condamnant pas ni les projectiles, ~~ni les tarés qui caillassent le bus~~. Il va même jusqu'à dire que c'est de la faute des lyonnais dans son communiqué. 

Maintenant oui il y eu des erreurs d'arbitrage, et la plus grosse pour moi n'est pas le penalty, même s'il pose question. C'est la claque de Benedetto, qui n'importe quelle intensité réelle qu'elle soit, ne doit pas exister sur un terrain de foot et est punie d'un rouge sur 98% des matchs. Que le joueur qui la reçoit simule ou non. Oui Dubois en fait trop, mais ce n'est pas la question.

Si ne serait ce qu'un dixième de ce qu'il s'est passé dimanche s'était passé à Lyon, on sait tous que les réactions seraient bien différentes.

Mea culpa sur ce coup là, j'avais lu le communiqué en diagonale et j'avais pas vu cette phrase là. Il ne condamne pas par contre les événements sur les corners.

>Tu bases sur quoi pour annoncer que les bus banalisés n'ont pas de double vitrage ? Personnellement je n'en sais rien mais ça m'étonnerait que les marseillais montent jouer à Paris sans un bus à double vitrage.

Sur ce que les lyonnais avaient dit, et ce qu'ils viennent de dire encore dans leur communiqué. J'ai du mal à imaginer qu'ils mentent la dessus vu que ça serait assez vite vérifiable pour les médias.

>Et à quel moment il y a eu de la ""mauvaise agressivité"" de la part des marseillais ?

Je parlais principalement de la fin de match, et du traitement réservé à Cherki qui a à peine 16 ans et qu'ils ont tombé durement plusieurs fois. Je suis entièrement d'accord pour dire que l'intensité était marseillaise, je l'ai même dit dans mon premier commentaire.

>Concernant Benedetto et Dubois, les deux aurait dû prendre un jaune. Le premier pour sa ""tape"" (claque c'est vraiment un grand mot) et l'autre pour son cinéma insupportable,

On voit pas grand chose sur les ralentis qu'ils ont montré, mais ça part quand même bien vite pour appleler ça une tape. Ça aurait vraiment pas été scandaleux qu'il prenne un rouge, et Dubois un jaune oui probablement.

>Ce qui est véritablement inadmissible par contre c'est l'intervention de Garibian qui désavoue publiquement un de ses arbitres.

Voilà. La on touche le cœur du problème et la raison de mon commentaire et de mon incrédulité sur la plupart des réactions. On est au lendemain d'un match où l'OM a clairement été avantagé par l'arbitrage (et donc L'OL désavantagé), et vous (les marseillais et les anti-lyonnais en général) réussissez quand même à agir en victime et à parler d'un soi disant favoritisme des instances et d'une connivence de JMA avec les arbitres. Je veux bien que vous haissez JMA, aucun soucis avec ça, c'est pas nouveau que sa réussite rend jaloux, mais là faut vraiment avoir un soucis. Garibian intervient dans le cadre d'un ""séminaire"" sur la VAR où sont invités tous les médias de France (même FootMercato a fait un article dessus et sur leur présence) et où il fait une sorte de premier bilan. Au lendemain de ce match, avec une erreur manifeste sur une nouvelle règle appliquée seulement cette saison, les mains offensives. Donc il précise la règle pour que tous les journalistes (dont l'Equipe) puisse la prochaine fois la connaître et éviter de dire et d'écrire des âneries. Ils l'aurait fait dans le même cas si l'action avait été inversée, et il l'aurait aussi fait si le match avait été un Rennes-Nantes ou n'importe quelle autre affiche du dimanche soir avec la même action. Faut vraiment avoir un problème pour dire que ça montre du favoritisme.",>caillassage bus cest honte contre JHE condamne cest mensonge pur simple extrait communiqué officiel Mea culpa coup javais lu communiqué diagonale javais phrase condamne contre événements corners >bases annoncer bus banalisés nont double vitrage ?

Je vois pas en quoi l'âge de Cherki est un argument ici, tu peux pas demander aux adversaires de lever le pied car il a 16 ans ! (je dirais même que ses adversaires devraient profiter du fait qu'il soit plus frêle pour le ""bouffer"" physiquement, sans chercher à lui casser un genou évidemment).

&#x200B;

> On est au lendemain d'un match où l'OM a clairement été avantagé par l'arbitrage 

Je veux bien admettre que certaines situations ont tournées à notre avantage (je suis d'accord avec toi le rouge pour Benedetto n'aurait pas été un scandale, un jaune non plus). Mais de là à dire qu'on a été CLAIREMENT avantagé, t'y vas fort. 

Je n'oublie pas les simulations de JRA (fin de première mi-temps) et d'Aouar (en début de deuxième, là où il se blesse) qui se laissent tomber dans la surface marseillaise et qui ne sont pas sanctionnés.

&#x200B;

> et vous (les marseillais et les anti-lyonnais en général) réussissez quand même à agir en victime 

C'est une blague ? Le seul à agir en victime ici c'est Jean-Michel ""ouin-ouin"" Aulas qui crie au scandale depuis le coup de sifflet final (en direct après le match sur le plateau du CFC) et sans discontinuité sur Twitter. Nous on s'étonne juste de l'intervention de Garibian.

Franchement ne pas admettre ça c'est être d'une mauvaise foi sans nom (ou lyonnais).

Frequently weaker teams have a time of intensity rush (usually at the start of the game) to overwhelm the strong team in order to get a goal early (if they are lucky), and defend the advantage/tie the rest of the game. Similar to a Blitzkrieg tactic. The problem is that usually after that time they deflate after the extremely taxing intensity period. We saw this at this game. Monterrey was garbo this game, but by sheer competency and basic game sense, they navigated with no effort to a goleada.

Andrada was key to defend those first 30 minutes. I don't see him as bad as other people say he is.

Stefan Medina, Gallardo and Romo, after being out for long, are clearly NOT READY for professional football. Stefan was directly responsible for the goal against.

Cortizo should stop flopping every time he carries the ball.

However with VAR it’s just opened a whole new can of worms. 

Technically, if it goes down it reverts back to the refs decision. Same with goal line tech. However the issue is that it doesn’t change the perception the AR has in that split moment thinking he’s got a backup.

1. Direct free kick  
A direct free kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offences against an opponent in a manner considered by the referee to be careless, reckless or using excessive force:  
charges  
jumps at  
kicks or attempts to kick  
pushes  
strikes or attempts to strike (including head-butt)  
tackles or challenges  
trips or attempts to trip  
If an offence involves contact it is penalised by a direct free kick or penalty kick.  
Careless is when a player shows a lack of attention or consideration when making a challenge or acts without precaution. No disciplinary sanction is needed  
Reckless is when a player acts with disregard to the danger to, or consequences for, an opponent and must be cautioned  
Using excessive force is when a player exceeds the necessary use of force and endangers the safety of an opponent and must be sent off

If you're familiar with the psychological concept of priming, I firmly believe this is going to prejudice the referee's decision towards a foul.

I also noticed that Shaun never viewed the footage at full speed. From the VAR Protocol:

*The referee can request different cameras angles/replay speeds but, in
general, slow motion replays should only be used for facts e.g. position of
offence/player, point of contact for physical offences and handball, ball out of
play (including goal/no goal); normal speed should be used for the ‘intensity’
of an offence or to decide if a handball was ‘deliberate’*  
  
It's a pity FIFA don't allow these conversations to be live.  

Take the potentially offside goal in the PG-CCM match.  We still have absolutely no idea why that goal was allowed.  Was the offside line considered too close?  Was the attacker considered to be not interfering?  Why?  

It's frustrating.", think conversation good like hearing – nt like shows point contact arm ref running making thing sees familiar psychological concept priming firmly believe going prejudice referees decision foul noticed Shaun viewed footage speed VAR Protocol *referee request different cameras angles/replay speeds general slow motion replays facts eg position offence/player point contact physical offences handball ball play including goal/goal normal speed ‘intensity’ offence decide handball ‘deliberate’* pity FIFA nt allow conversations live potentially offside goal PG-CCM match absolutely idea goal allowed offside line considered close? attacker considered interfering? ? frustrating,en,en,2021,ALeague,"[{'label': 'Very Negative', 'score': 0.3459649085998535}]",Very Negative,0.3459649085998535,"[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.49300405383110046}]",Neutral,0.49300405383110046,Negative

A bit of luck in that equaliser too, that first corner looked like a clear foul in their favour.

The same old problem from the World Cup, good areas and attacking moves but just too indecisive in the box. Ryan and Risdon best on ground for us, Rogic good in the first half. I love Mooy but he really lacked creativity, probably a result of playing at a team that largely plays without the ball in Huddersfield, though I suspect with Rogic on the park he is also told to be a bit less creative in his deeper role.

In my understanding of football, this is no pen. Liva isn't even looking at his legs, and he's looking to fall anyway. A gray position closer to no pen. Ref not giving it at first for me is a good take. After going to VAR though, ref has to give it. Contact is clear. No ref that won't give it after watching slow-mo, that's the reality of VAR. Both of these calls, giving the pen with VAR and not giving it on the pitch are understandable decisions.

The issue here is on VAR imo, there is a communications issue. VAR just calls the ref for a review after telling him there is contact. The correct question is to ask ""have you seen the contact"" first. Only if the ref says ""no"" then a review is merited. If the ref says ""yes, I didn't think the contact is a pen"" then VAR cannot say ""but I think it is"". VAR cannot comment on positions. Only reasonable way for this turn of events is the ref thinking contact is a pen but the ball is out, going to review to check if it was in.

Yarım saatte 3 atıp, 50. dakikada da penaltı alınca Uğurcan'ın gelmesine ""Lan taşak mı geçiyor bizimle"" demelerini doğal karşılarım. Niyet o olmasa bile, random Sivaslı oyuncuların ve taraftarların, Uğurcan'ın iki saat önce çocuğunun doğduğunu ve gol atıp ona hediye etmek istediğini bilmeleri mümkün değil, ki Trabzonlu arkadaşlar yorumlarda açıklamasa ne ben biliyordum, ne de buradaki diğerleri biliyordu. 

Context yokken, 3-0 laylaylom gidiyor, kalecinin penaltıcılıkla alakası yokken oraya gelmesi, forvetlerin kaleciyi çalımlayıp, kale çizgisinde durdurup, eğilip kafayla iteklemesi gibi bir şey. Dediğim gibi, Uğurcan'ın contextini bilmezkenki durumdan bahsediyorum. Güzel bir jest düşüncesiydi bence, ama şartlar talihsizdi.

Son dakikalarda kafaya çıkmayı doğru bir benzetme olarak görmüyorum. Son dakika kornerine çıkmak çaresizlikten, ihtimali arttırmak için yapılan bir risk. 3-0 öndeyken gönder kalecini, başka hiçbir oyuncunu da ceza sahasına sokma, o zaman da derler ""Taşak mı geçiyorsun bizle"" diye.

Ha maç 0-0'dır mesela, veya 1-0 geridesindir, o zaman kalecin kullanmaya kalkarsa kimse kendisiyle dalga geçildiğini düşünmez, ""Ne kadar güveniyorlar kalecilerine"" derler.

Salazar'ın Üç F'si (Portekizce: três F de Salazar), Portekiz'in 1932'den 1968'e kadar başbakanlığını yapan António de Oliveira Salazar'ın de facto totaliter rejiminin dayanağı kabul edilen ifadedir. Üç F ifadesi futbol, fado ve Fátima'yı temsil eder. İfade sıklıkla yanlış olarak Salazar yerine İspanyol diktatör Francisco Franco'nun rejimine atfedilerek Fátima yerine fiesta ifadesini temsilen kullanılır. Üç F ifadesi, Estado Novo rejimini yıkan Karanfil Devriminin ardından Salazar'ın meşruiyetinin ana dayanağı olarak yaygınlaşmıştır.

Üç F, Salazar'ın meşruiyetinin halkın spor, eğlence ve din ile uyuşturulmasıyla sağlandığını ifade eder. Futbolun Portekiz'de önemli yer tutması ve bir Portekiz halk müziği olan fado spor ve eğlence ile ilişkilendirilirken Katoliklerin hac noktalarından Fátima, din ile ilişkilendirilmektedir. Bu ifade, ideolojik olarak ise bazen milliyetçilik, muhafazakârlık ve dindarlık ilkeleriyle ilişkilendirilmektedir.

The problem is, our front three was right in our starting 11 but our midfield was waaay too soft. Then our midfield got more tough, but we subbed our most dangerous players. 

Looks like we are missing another world cup, but i think as the coach knows the players more, we might get better. Subbing off Cengiz was the wrong move.

Edit: some more thoughts. I have never seen a left back kill so many attacks, it was actually impressive. Kerem kept showing him runs and Caner was like, nah i am just gonna kick it.

If you brought in all english referees team and all matches in turkish league where refereed by english referees, while the intensity of game would most likely improve, there'd still be mistakes and they'd protect each other over it.

Also, after the Ankaragucu incident and lack of consequences of it, not sure if foreign referees would be eager to join the league, and if they do the ones worth joining might be better off elsewhere anyway so it could be the lower quality of the bunch.

This is what you expect from fan accounts, not officials. If you want to contest a call, do it - I've got no problem with that. But to constantly bring it up for hours on end really is a new low.

Now onto the actual position - the hardest thing to contest is a VAR offside. I can understand if the referee doesn't give a penalty in a position or something since that is all subjective, but an offside is objective, using technology such as calibrated cameras to help in making the decision. The PL has a whole section on their website talking about this, and how certain camera angles can be deceiving without VAR, such as this one for example. Although it is always possible for something to be slightly off, it is extremely unlikely with VAR. To continue off of this, I love how FB fans who are bringing this up fail to recognize the two potential penalty calls GS could've gotten through VAR but weren't looked at. They just need to recognize that GS played better today and deserved the win, it's as simple as that. 

To wrap this up though, in an ideal world the TFF and MHK would be transparent with their decisions which can shut down speculation and all these stupid arguments.

I want your opinions.,Referees Fenerbahce games want opinions,"If you're not going to attach some statistical evidence (compare to when lost points, compare to other big teams, compare to previous seasons) when you're making claims like this then I think it belongs in the club subreddit. Because as it is now there isn't anything to discuss and it will just turn into a shitshow with ""agla"" type of comments and baseless accusations. We've removed all such comments and OT comments.

---

Below is the first stats that I came to think of, even if there may be some truth to the claims (which I'll agree to if shown compelling evidence) I think this is quite telling.

There are 24 referees and only 9 games every week, some are gonna be cut every week. But lets look at the refs from the games where FB won:

* 1. week: Arda Kardesler
* 2. week: Halil Umut Meler
* 5. week: Abdulkadir Bitigen
* 8. week: Firat Aydinus
* 9. week: Ali Sansalan
* 11. week: Ali Palabiyik

Now lets look at the top list of how many games each ref has officiated, refs listed above in bold:

Referee errors are a big part of sports debate, both in other football leagues and in other sports. In the Premier League, Serie A, and La Liga, some mistakes affect the winner of the match and even who will be relegated from the league. If you watch the matches in these leagues, you will see the same. The situation is not much different in other sports. Referee decisions were also very influential in Verstappen's F1 championship in 2021. In the NBA, it is constantly mentioned that the referees favor some players. It is always mentioned that some teams are protected in international and national basketball matches in Europe. Fans cry about it all the time. But the biggest difference between TSL and other leagues is the attitude of the clubs towards these mistakes. While in other leagues the clubs remain silent because the penalties are very harsh, here each club blames its every failure on the referee's decisions. In the Bundesliga, where Bayern has been champion for 10 years in a row, while no club says that Bayern has become the champion thanks to the referees, everyone is talking about the referees in our league, where different teams compete for the championship every year. The performance of the Turkish referees may be lower than the performance of the referees in the leagues I have mentioned, but the main reason why the referees are talked about so much is not their performance, but the football culture here.",realize referees problem TSL Referee errors big sports debate football leagues sports Premier League Serie La Liga mistakes affect winner match relegated league watch matches leagues situation different sports Referee decisions influential Verstappens F1 championship 2021 NBA constantly mentioned referees favor players mentioned teams protected international national basketball matches Europe Fans cry time biggest difference TSL leagues attitude clubs mistakes leagues clubs remain silent penalties harsh club blames failure referees decisions Bundesliga Bayern champion 10 years row club says Bayern champion thanks referees talking referees league different teams compete championship year performance Turkish referees lower performance referees leagues mentioned main reason referees talked performance football culture ,en,en,2023,superlig,"[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.3220256567001343}]",Neutral,0.3220256567001343,"[{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.3927357494831085}]",Neutral,0.3927357494831085,Neutral

But I think the main reaction to Onyekuru’s position stem from the fact that many people, including me, was expecting something like that to go down after Rize awarded a red card after Emre's unlucky position. Unlike the 3rd minute penalty awarded to us in the first game of the season, Onyekuru's penalty was also a very critical turning point and a huge decision. Plus, one difference is also that, in Kruse's position the defender makes the tackle from behind and both fall down as a result of the impact. In Henry's position you can see him stepping his foot on the ground first and then fall afterwards.

But I agree with your point nevertheless. These kind of positions show the deep down hypocrisies we all have. If it's against my team, why then it is clearly a penalty. But if it's against yours, clearly not. This vicious cycle needs to come to an end at some point.

Don’t get me wrong, if a keeper holds the ball for 18 seconds than a referee should call it. Same with Altay’s saving the penalty: if a keeper’s foot is not on the line, it should be replied. HOWEVER, these rules should be applied to all teams indiscrimanetly. When referees consistently enforce rules that are disadvantaging only one team and be more lax in calling it for other teams, then it is only natural to seek an ulterior motive here.
